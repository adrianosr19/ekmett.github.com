		<description>Good catch. 

I added Control.Comonad.Exponent in response to a comment over on Dan Piponi&#039;s blog and forgot that I had those in progress at the time.

Fixed and uploading to hackage as I write this.

I may drop Dyad though, since it doesn&#039;t add much value. As near as I can tell there are no interesting dyads in Haskell that aren&#039;t just monads or comonads, and they force a profusion of typeclasses to define that lack other uses. This may also explain why there has been no followup to Fokkinga&#039;s paper on them in the last 14 years. The distributive law is required to be a natural isomorphism, which seems to be too strong to be practical.</description>

		<description>Off-topic, but it looks like Allegory.hs and Dyad.hs have not been added to darcs in category-extras?</description>
