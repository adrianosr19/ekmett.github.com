		<description>Johan/Greg, it got bumped again for time constraints. We did a group coding exercise based on a card trick that took up both hours, which gave the session a nice introductory feel, and tackled a fun encoding problem.

That said, Ravi did bring a video camera today, so when we finally get a chance to do the talk, we should be able to have some semblance of video. ;)</description>

		<description>Hi Greg:

I&#039;ll post the slides afterwards if I make any major changes. The slides used probably won&#039;t be appreciably different than the second set of slides I posted before, because this is the second talk I had intended to give at last month&#039;s meeting, before we ran out of time.

As for video, etc. We currently don&#039;t have any good way to capture it in the facility we are in. I&#039;ll pass the word to Ravi that people are interested in such things.</description>

		<description>Hi Brian, the first two parts of the &#039;trifecta&#039; the iteratee-based parsec stream can be used for parsing network data as it comes available. 

The monoidal layer I add on top for paralelism, on the other hand, is somewhat less useful in that scenario. =)</description>

		<description>Is the trifecta going to provide a way to parse network data with Parsec and iteratees (i.e., directly from sockets)? That would be great for network clients and servers.</description>
