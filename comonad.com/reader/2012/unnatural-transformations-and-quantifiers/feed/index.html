		<description>I really don&#039;t like maths that much but it always fascinate me like magic. This site is very informative and useful for the maths students, so please keep updating.</description>

		<description>I actually stumbled on to this site when I was looking for something else. I found it very interesting and informative. I am doing my graduation with major as math. I would appreciate if you keep updating regularly.</description>

		<description>A while back I was playing with free theorems and was surprised to find types for which the free theorem wasn&#039;t the obvious expression of (di)naturality. I was a bit perturbed. I guess I should have considered it a feature rather than a bug and investigated further.</description>
