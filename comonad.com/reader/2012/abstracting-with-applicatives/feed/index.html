		<description>Cool post, reminds me about a similar observation I made about the writer monad (http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/10/generalizing-the-programmable-semicolon/); namely, that the tracing behaviour of writer is independent of the computational component.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the comments -- I&#039;ve fixed the post appropriately. I came across &quot;Sum&quot; on my own, and I wasn&#039;t familiar with the &quot;Lift&quot; specialization of it in transformers. Not surprised that Conor and Ross beat me to it!

As the edited post notes, we can&#039;t actually add that Identity instance for Natural without overlapping too often with the Const instance. The poor typechecker can&#039;t decide if it should send everything to Const, or Identity to anything.</description>

		<description>In the example of the FailingWriter, you write &#039;runFailingWriter $ ...&#039;, but don&#039;t provide a definition of it. From the actual output, I don&#039;t think you actually meant to write it, as the current output makes it seem that the definition would just be `id`. Or perhaps you meant to provide a definition that would yield a different output, perhaps (monoid, Maybe a), stripping away the newtype noise?</description>

		<description>Great article!

I came across the Sum applicative for the first time just two days ago in this comment on Stack Overflow by Conor McBride [1]. There he notes Identity is the initial Applicative functor, so you can replace that last Natural instance with:

instance Applicative g =&gt; Natural Identity g where
    eta (Identity x) = pure x

		<description>Const c &gt;&gt;= f doesn&#039;t work

return a &gt;&gt;= f = f a is a Monad law.

Consider:

return a &gt;&gt;= \ _ -&gt; Const &quot;hello&quot;

But from that definition 

return a &gt;&gt;= \ _ -&gt; Const &quot;hello&quot; = Const &quot;&quot;

but

(\ _ -&gt; Const &quot;hello&quot;) a = Const &quot;hello&quot;

Your proposal only works when mempty is the only value of your monoid. It works for Const (), but nothing else really.</description>

		<description>Oh, I see.  You couldn&#039;t define bind in a way that is consistent with the Applicative instance (and we had Monoid c anyway so return wouldn&#039;t have been a problem).  Sloppy reading :-/</description>

		<description>It seems to me that the reason that Const c is not a monad is because of return, not bind.  Const c &gt;&gt;= f = Const c  should do the trick.</description>
