0:00:00.809,0:00:05.180
Hi everyone. I want to welcome 
to the second New York Haskell meetup

0:00:05.180,0:00:09.080
It is a great crowd just like last time
Thank everyone for coming, it was a great...

0:00:09.080,0:00:11.419
holiday party yesterday

0:00:11.419,0:00:13.969
I just want to make two quick pitches

0:00:14.969,0:00:17.659
First is we've got a great crowd but

0:00:17.659,0:00:20.289
there's room for more so if you know
people that would be interested in

0:00:20.289,0:00:24.499
coming, publicity is great.
We want to promote our great language

0:00:24.499,0:00:28.889
Number two, um... we're lining up a lot
of good talks but it's always good to

0:00:28.889,0:00:33.239
have as many talks is possible lined up
so if you are interested in giving a

0:00:33.239,0:00:35.790
talk be it a small talk,  a long talk

0:00:35.790,0:00:40.110
on just a little project you did or you
know a lot more sort of lengthy

0:00:40.110,0:00:42.190
presentation um...

0:00:42.190,0:00:46.160
talk to myself .. That is Rich Minerich
in the back there, he is one of

0:00:46.160,0:00:50.670
the organizers of the Haskell meet up as well 
Doug is up here. If you want to

0:00:50.670,0:00:53.710
stand up and wave "hi," so people know who
the organizer are who they could talk to about

0:00:53.710,0:00:55.810
whatever they want

0:00:55.810,0:00:57.410
Ryan is

0:00:57.410,0:01:00.310
somewhere and um... yes

0:01:00.310,0:01:03.520
That's one, two, three, four uh...

0:01:03.520,0:01:07.300
Am I forgetting.. Oz! but he's not
here.. is he here tonight?

0:01:07.300,0:01:12.790
Okay, so those are the organizers.
Come talk to us if you want to present or

0:01:12.790,0:01:15.980
about anything else.
And now i'm going to introduce Ed Kmett.

0:01:15.980,0:01:21.250
Edward Kmett who is a co-worker
of mine at Standard and Poor Capital I_Q_

0:01:21.250,0:01:25.320
He's written a zillion and one
libraries and uh...

0:01:25.320,0:01:29.200
he discovered with the lens library
that if he added documentation

0:01:31.450,0:01:36.440
that he got a lot more users! So this
is actually rapidly acquiring

0:01:36.440,0:01:40.960
a reputation and finding widespread
use and it's really cool, so he

0:01:40.960,0:01:42.870
going to tell us all about it.
Thank you, Ed.

0:01:42.870,0:01:46.240
I'm going to waffle back and forth
between

0:01:46.240,0:01:49.770
some slides that I have that have a
lot of the theory and motivation

0:01:49.770,0:01:52.510
like from a technical standpoint
for lenses

0:01:52.510,0:01:54.680
and just like a G_H_C_I_ session where

0:01:54.680,0:01:56.359
I'll use them in practice so that

0:01:56.359,0:02:00.840
even if you're having trouble following along
with the theory and the derivation

0:02:00.840,0:02:02.390
you can see them used

0:02:02.390,0:02:06.369
and get a feel for how you'd use them in
your own Haskell code. All right?

0:02:10.159,0:02:12.939
So, um...

0:02:12.939,0:02:14.700
I've got a lot of material to cover today.

0:02:14.700,0:02:18.489
So I'm going to ramble on for
a couple of hours. I apologize.

0:02:19.789,0:02:24.379
So I guess the first question is:
What is a lens?

0:02:24.379,0:02:30.199
In imperative code you can very easily

0:02:30.199,0:02:35.389
read and write to like nested getters and setters
way down in a hierarchy.

0:02:35.389,0:02:39.459
I can call "foo . bar . baz . quux" and "+= 10"

0:02:39.459,0:02:41.529
and I don't really

0:02:41.529,0:02:46.539
think too hard about violating what.. what the

0:02:46.539,0:02:48.620
Eiffel guys call the Law of Demeter

0:02:48.620,0:02:52.239
and going down and accessing properties
of properties of properties.

0:02:52.239,0:02:57.950
In a functional setting it's a lot
harder to do that though, because

0:02:57.950,0:03:02.479
I have to.. maybe I use record syntax and
I have to go in and

0:03:02.479,0:03:06.599
it costs me more and more, because I
have to keep talking about the same objects

0:03:06.599,0:03:08.689
to go deeper and deeper.

0:03:08.689,0:03:13.449
So, record updates are not very
compositional.

0:03:13.449,0:03:14.419
um...

0:03:14.419,0:03:21.089
and so PLT Borat based on.. actually I
think a version of a talk Tony gave

0:03:21.089,0:03:22.099
on lenses..

0:03:22.099,0:03:23.419
Tony Morris

0:03:24.290,0:03:27.110
said something to the effect that
costate comonad coalgebras are the equivalent of

0:03:27.110,0:03:30.319
Java's variable update technology for Haskell

0:03:30.319,0:03:33.579
And that

0:03:33.579,0:03:37.269
is really .. if you take nothing else away
from what a lens is

0:03:37.269,0:03:40.939
it's getters and setters, we just

0:03:40.939,0:03:43.979
smash them together into

0:03:43.979,0:03:47.760
some kind of object.
So simplest form of a lans that we might

0:03:47.760,0:03:50.059
make would be to pair

0:03:50.059,0:03:52.279
the getter let's call it "view" here

0:03:52.279,0:03:53.389
with a setter

0:03:53.389,0:03:56.669
so we will get an "a" out of an "s"

0:03:56.669,0:03:58.069
and we'll set

0:03:58.069,0:03:59.369
taking an "s"

0:03:59.369,0:04:01.679
and a new "a" that we want to replace into it

0:04:01.679,0:04:03.309
and well give you a new "s".

0:04:03.309,0:04:06.260
Okay? And we want to put some common
sense laws on these.

0:04:06.260,0:04:08.389
Okay? We can actually drive these laws

0:04:08.389,0:04:11.059
about four or five different ways
and they all give you the same laws so that

0:04:11.059,0:04:11.979
kind of gives us

0:04:11.979,0:04:14.209
a hint that we're onto the right abstraction

0:04:15.369,0:04:19.100
and one is is that if i "get" something

0:04:19.100,0:04:20.749
out of my "whole"

0:04:20.749,0:04:21.889
and i put it back

0:04:21.889,0:04:26.720
it's the same as if i didn't do anything,
so a lens has no other effects.

0:04:26.720,0:04:29.759
Right? It doesn't bump a counter somewhere
inside the object, it doesn't do

0:04:29.759,0:04:31.199
anything like that.

0:04:31.199,0:04:34.399
All I can do is read and write to part of it.

0:04:34.399,0:04:40.330
And if I put something in, I have
to be able to get back out.

0:04:40.330,0:04:44.379
Okay? And finally, if i "set" twice.. I
set it to something and i set it to

0:04:44.379,0:04:50.249
something else, it's just like I did the
second setting. The first setting didn't matter

0:04:50.249,0:04:58.990
So these three laws let us reason
about code that uses lenses.

0:04:59.800,0:05:06.870
I gave an answer on stack overflow that
goes on for hundreds of lines about this

0:05:06.870,0:05:09.580
using this exact formulation of lenses.
We're not going to be using this kind

0:05:09.580,0:05:11.239
of lens today.

0:05:11.239,0:05:14.119
[laughter]

0:05:14.119,0:05:16.139
um...

0:05:16.139,0:05:21.029
it goes so far and then stops.

0:05:21.029,0:05:23.050
So, to talk about that

0:05:23.050,0:05:27.379
costate comonad coalgebra,
just long enough to throw it away:

0:05:28.639,0:05:32.780
So what that means is is that if we were
to take this definition

0:05:32.780,0:05:36.409
they both start with an "s" and so I
could theoretically just these two

0:05:36.409,0:05:38.029
functions together into one function.

0:05:38.029,0:05:40.070
I give you a function that
gives you back a pair

0:05:40.070,0:05:49.199
of the "a" to "s" and the "a".
Right? And that construction on the end

0:05:49.199,0:05:53.539
happens to be the store comonad
or the costate comonad

0:05:53.539,0:05:56.529
if you want to go about it from a
theoretical perspective.

0:05:56.529,0:06:00.830
and this is a store comonad coalgebra

0:06:00.830,0:06:04.379
and the laws to be a comonad coalgebra
in this case are exactly the lens laws

0:06:04.379,0:06:05.490
that we just stated.

0:06:05.490,0:06:09.409
Okay? So that is a completely different
way to give the exact same laws.

0:06:09.409,0:06:13.129
I think that the common sense version
makes more sense.

0:06:14.499,0:06:17.399
This one is also in this is uh...

0:06:17.399,0:06:20.879
the approach that I used
in my data-lens library.

0:06:20.879,0:06:25.960
That was the lens library that I used to
sell everybody before this one.

0:06:25.960,0:06:29.150
I handed off maintainership on that and then I

0:06:29.150,0:06:33.189
subsequently stabbed poor Russell in the back
by implementing a new lens library

0:06:33.189,0:06:34.330
[laughter]

0:06:34.330,0:06:37.630
So this is like if we were to look
at the version inside of

0:06:37.630,0:06:38.529
data-lens

0:06:38.529,0:06:41.330
but the only reason why I wanted to point to this
is that you can build a category

0:06:41.330,0:06:43.459
for these, where you can compose these.

0:06:44.330,0:06:47.679
The Category class basically says that
you have (.) which lets you

0:06:47.679,0:06:50.789
compose things kind of like functions.

0:06:50.789,0:06:52.999
"You can compose arrows in the category."

0:06:52.999,0:06:55.759
and that there is an identity arrow for

0:06:55.759,0:06:57.829
every object

0:06:57.829,0:07:01.339
There will not be a test on this code.
We're not going to use it.

0:07:03.080,0:07:06.540
The problem with this approach is that
somebody has to remember to

0:07:06.540,0:07:08.000
import Control.Category

0:07:08.000,0:07:10.919
They have to hide a couple of
things from the Prelude.

0:07:10.919,0:07:12.099
uh...

0:07:12.099,0:07:14.969
What I want to do is I want to write
lenses that I don't need

0:07:14.969,0:07:17.469
to go off to Control.Category and grab id and (.)

0:07:17.469,0:07:23.189
and along the way we're going to get some
extra stuff for free.

0:07:23.189,0:07:26.809
I was holding this up as kind of a straw man.

0:07:26.809,0:07:28.030
All right.

0:07:28.030,0:07:31.779
So there is a um...

0:07:31.779,0:07:34.650
This is a reference to a talk that was given
by Eric Meijer

0:07:34.650,0:07:37.719
..probably ten years ago..

0:07:37.719,0:07:41.559
about a bunch of language features that
eventually became um...

0:07:41.559,0:07:45.740
LINQ inside of C#

0:07:45.740,0:07:47.810
and it is what we need

0:07:47.810,0:07:50.800
I haskell we often have -- there's an idiom that
we use over and over again

0:07:50.800,0:07:53.219
that you'll see in

0:07:53.219,0:07:57.739
certainly people's code ... that is,
like, if we start with like say dot here

0:07:57.739,0:08:01.080
I can work with dot dot dot

0:08:01.080,0:08:06.309
okay and now it's like dot goes into
a function of one argument.

0:08:06.309,0:08:08.770
"(.) . (.)" will go into

0:08:08.770,0:08:14.990
two functions deep. Right?

0:08:14.990,0:08:16.490
"(.) . (.) . (.)"

0:08:16.490,0:08:20.319
will go three functions deep.
So, as many dots as I compose here

0:08:20.319,0:08:25.089
I am going to nest that many arguments
in the function.

0:08:25.089,0:08:27.369
This is um..

0:08:27.369,0:08:31.609
I believe Conal Elliott called them
semantic editor combinators and he

0:08:31.609,0:08:33.510
gave them all sorts of fancy names.

0:08:33.510,0:08:35.800
Uh... we can do this with "fmap".

0:08:35.800,0:08:37.770
instead of functions, because

0:08:37.770,0:08:40.730
the definition of

0:08:40.730,0:08:44.160
fmap for the function functor

0:08:44.160,0:08:46.340
for a function from "a" or whatever.

0:08:46.340,0:08:47.930
uh... is fmap

0:08:47.930,0:08:49.550
rather, fmap is (.).

0:08:49.550,0:08:51.080
we can generalize this pattern

0:08:51.080,0:08:54.950
and say, "well, I can go go and instead of
going with fmap where I can go under

0:08:54.950,0:08:55.910
one functor

0:08:55.910,0:08:58.420
I can go under two or three.

0:08:58.420,0:09:05.420
"fmap" or "fmap . fmap" or "fmap . fmap . fmap".
Okay?

0:09:08.400,0:09:09.790
Interestingly,

0:09:09.790,0:09:12.950
The order of these arguments is kind of
reversed from what you'd expect as I'm

0:09:12.950,0:09:13.850
taking

0:09:13.850,0:09:16.200
upon function from "a" to "b"

0:09:16.200,0:09:20.360
to a function from ah..

0:09:20.360,0:09:22.470
"f a" to "f b". Er.. Lets go here:

0:09:22.470,0:09:27.150
A function from "a -> b" to a function
from "f a -> f b".

0:09:27.150,0:09:28.280
and so

0:09:28.280,0:09:30.630
each one of the is

0:09:30.630,0:09:33.540
the dot is actually reading backwards
from the way you would

0:09:33.540,0:09:36.780
come at it from a Haskell perspective.
Er.. as you'd think about it from a Haskell

0:09:36.780,0:09:39.050
perspective usually.

0:09:41.230,0:09:46.940
So these are semantic editor combinators and...

0:09:46.940,0:09:50.580
Conal gave these all sorts of fun names.
We have "result" was dot, and "element" was

0:09:50.580,0:09:53.270
"fmap" and "second", and you can compose

0:09:53.270,0:09:56.800
"element . result . second" and

0:09:56.800,0:09:58.500
walked down

0:09:58.500,0:09:59.990
in for

0:09:59.990,0:10:02.800
editing assignments and what not

0:10:02.800,0:10:06.230
uh... I'm going to make an alias for this
just for sake of discussion, because this is going

0:10:06.230,0:10:09.300
to be the same pattern for aliases
I'm going to use

0:10:09.300,0:10:13.020
for the kind of lenses that I want.

0:10:13.020,0:10:14.110
and so

0:10:14.110,0:10:16.900
a semantic editor combinator

0:10:16.900,0:10:20.330
is going to say given an "s"

0:10:20.330,0:10:22.060
and a function from "a" to "b"

0:10:22.060,0:10:23.990
I can give you a "t"

0:10:23.990,0:10:26.910
So this is like fmap

0:10:26.910,0:10:34.210
Right? If this was "f a" and this was "f b"
this would be the signature of "fmap".

0:10:34.210,0:10:38.830
But also "fmap . fmap" firts this pattern,
because I didn't actually prejudge that this

0:10:38.830,0:10:41.460
had the shape "f a"

0:10:41.460,0:10:45.170
"s" could be lots of different things.

0:10:45.170,0:10:49.380
So "fmap . fmap" is a semantic editor combinator.

0:10:49.380,0:10:53.589
and "fmap . fmap . fmap" or
"result . element . second . first"

0:10:53.589,0:11:03.930
All of these would be valid semantic editor combinators.

0:11:08.100,0:11:09.770
And if you look at "fmap",

0:11:09.770,0:11:12.810
"fmap" is then a semantic editor combinator
that says

0:11:12.810,0:11:18.550
given "f a" and a function from "a" to "b", I
can give you an "f b"

0:11:18.550,0:11:20.970
You can just put a different signature on it.

0:11:20.970,0:11:26.400
Right? Because this expands to the existing definition of "fmap".

0:11:26.400,0:11:29.710
er.. the existing signature.

0:11:29.710,0:11:31.840
and then "first" will

0:11:31.840,0:11:36.100
walk over the first element of a pair.
which while, this guy is obvious not a "functor"

0:11:36.100,0:11:39.230
you know in the capital "F" sense of "Functor"

0:11:39.230,0:11:42.020
but it still has that same kind of
functoriality of it.

0:11:42.020,0:11:47.010
It's just the functor over
the first half of a pair.

0:11:47.010,0:11:50.880
given a pair of "a" and "c"

0:11:50.880,0:11:57.880
and a function from "a" to "b",
I can give you a pair of "b" and "c"

0:12:00.140,0:12:03.180
So this leads us to the first
construction that we're gonna deal with

0:12:03.180,0:12:05.560
in the lens library that is not a lens.

0:12:07.870,0:12:11.730
We will talk about setters.

0:12:11.730,0:12:13.350
So, the same way that we built, er..

0:12:13.350,0:12:14.920
that we can compose dots

0:12:14.920,0:12:17.660
in series and we can compose "fmap"s in series

0:12:17.660,0:12:21.560
uh... these these are an idiom that a lot
of people know in the Haskell world.

0:12:21.560,0:12:25.590
These get used a fair bit in real in
real production code.

0:12:25.590,0:12:30.630
um... a less-known idiom is that you can
compose Traversable functors the same way

0:12:30.630,0:12:36.950
How many people here are familiar with
Data.Traversable? So I have some idea.

0:12:36.950,0:12:42.420
Ok..  How many are familiar with, like, "mapM"?

0:12:42.420,0:12:45.910
"traverse" is like a generalized "mapM".

0:12:45.910,0:12:52.280
uh... "Applicative" is slightly weaker than "Monad".

0:12:52.280,0:12:54.520
Okay? With an "Applicative" you don't get..

0:12:54.520,0:13:00.900
er you only get that there is a combinator "ap"

0:13:00.900,0:13:05.080
or "liftA2" or whatever that you can use
that instead of "bind".

0:13:05.080,0:13:08.000
So you don't have all the power to
choose the next calculation based on

0:13:08.000,0:13:10.110
what value you've gotten out before,

0:13:10.110,0:13:15.630
but you can still
stitch together "Applicative" results

0:13:15.630,0:13:16.740
Okay?

0:13:16.740,0:13:23.250
And "traverse" looks like this:
It says given a function from "a" to "b" that has

0:13:23.250,0:13:25.610
"Applicative" side-effects in "m",

0:13:25.610,0:13:27.039
I can take an "f a" and give you an "m (f b)"

0:13:27.039,0:13:38.390
and if this was "mapM", this would be 
a "Monad" "m".

0:13:38.390,0:13:40.480
and if it's "mapM" out of "Control.Monad",

0:13:40.480,0:13:47.480
that'd probably have "[]" here.

0:13:47.760,0:13:53.100
So the "Traversable" class says "I don't care
what kind of Applicative you give me..

0:13:53.100,0:13:55.340
you give me an Applicative, and I will

0:13:55.340,0:14:09.980
walk through my "f" and find all the "a"s in it
turn them into "b"s and give you back "f b"

0:14:09.980,0:14:12.670
but if you look at the signature here

0:14:12.670,0:14:17.650
we can compose this! "traverse . traverse"
looks a lot like "traverse"

0:14:17.650,0:14:20.460
just in the same way that "fmap . fmap"
looked kind of like "fmap"

0:14:21.410,0:14:30.350
I just now have "f (g a)" and I'm not bolting
a "Compose" newtype in here to make this really painful

0:14:30.350,0:14:33.620
to work with

0:14:33.620,0:14:36.360
here with "traverse . traverse"

0:14:36.360,0:14:42.330
I'm now saying if you give me "f (g a)",
I'll go in there. I'll go into the "f"

0:14:42.330,0:14:43.720
I'll find all the "g a"s.

0:14:43.720,0:14:47.690
I'll go into the "g"s find all of the "a"s
Transform them into "b"s using your

0:14:47.690,0:14:49.200
Applicative side-effects

0:14:49.200,0:14:53.490
and I'll pull the Applicative side-effects
all the way out through the "f".

0:14:53.490,0:14:55.930
And similarly: "traverse . traverse . traverse"

0:14:55.930,0:14:59.450
So i can keep going deeper and deeper

0:14:59.450,0:15:02.259
you can actually mix and match these 
"traverse . fmap . ...", but

0:15:02.259,0:15:03.900
they start doing strange things.
You have to be careful.

0:15:08.210,0:15:11.250
And that actually leads us to why we
want to do something slightly different

0:15:11.250,0:15:16.970
So I want a version of "fmap" that
I can compose with "traverse" in the same way

0:15:16.970,0:15:20.200
So I could say I can go into a "Functor"
where I only have a "Functor" for it, but

0:15:20.200,0:15:25.230
I have a "Traversable" for this other
other outer container.

0:15:25.230,0:15:29.480
So if we look at the definition for the
class of "Traversable"

0:15:29.480,0:15:34.000
"Traversable"s have two super classes.
We're gonna gloss over one for

0:15:34.000,0:15:38.230
about ten minutes until I need it

0:15:38.230,0:15:43.790
But every "Traversable" is a "Functor"

0:15:43.790,0:15:45.860
because given the definition of "traverse"

0:15:45.860,0:15:48.100
i can choose an appropriate "Applicative"

0:15:48.100,0:15:51.780
to be able to derive the definition

0:15:51.780,0:15:54.440
of "fmap". i could use the "Identity"

0:15:54.440,0:15:57.590
monad, or the "Identity" "Applicative"

0:15:57.590,0:16:00.770
and then this becomes "a -> Identity b"

0:16:00.770,0:16:01.589
abated

0:16:01.589,0:16:06.140
and "f a -> Identity (f b)" and I can
just put on or off the newtype wrapper.

0:16:06.140,0:16:12.470
and I can derivate "fmap" from "traverse".

0:16:12.470,0:16:16.900
Okay? So that motivates the superclass

0:16:16.900,0:16:19.370
of "Functor" for "Traversable".

0:16:19.370,0:16:22.220
And um...

0:16:22.220,0:16:28.080
there is an "fmapDefault" that is provided
for you in "Data.Traversable".

0:16:28.080,0:16:29.840
which is

0:16:29.840,0:16:33.430
a valid definition of "fmap".

0:16:33.430,0:16:37.510
So if you've written a "Traversable" instance for a type
you could just use "fmap = fmapDefault" and

0:16:37.510,0:16:39.670
you'll get the uh... the "Functor"

0:16:39.670,0:16:42.020
for it. It will define it for you.

0:16:42.020,0:16:45.780
You won't have to walk through your whole
your syntax tree a second time doing

0:16:45.780,0:16:51.820
the same thing just without the
"Applicative" side-effects

0:16:51.820,0:16:56.380
But let's take that guy apart.

0:16:56.380,0:16:58.750
The source code for "fmapDefault"

0:16:58.750,0:16:59.620
says

0:16:59.620,0:17:00.750
I'm going to "traverse"

0:17:00.750,0:17:04.010
I'm going to take the function that you gave me
from "a -> b" and I'm going to

0:17:04.010,0:17:08.510
bolt an "Identity" in and I'm going to give you
an (a -> Identity b) so not that is suitable so that

0:17:08.510,0:17:11.740
I can pass it to "traverse".

0:17:11.740,0:17:12.770
um...

0:17:12.770,0:17:17.590
Then this will be.. this will take in my "f a"s

0:17:17.590,0:17:20.910
and this is going give me back an "Identity (f b)"

0:17:20.910,0:17:24.589
So I'll "runIdentity" to rip the "Identity" of and
I'll have an "f b".

0:17:24.589,0:17:29.070
This build "fmap" out of "traverse".

0:17:29.070,0:17:32.320
just using "Identity" out of like "Data.Functor.Identity"

0:17:32.320,0:17:39.320
This is in "transformers".

0:17:39.880,0:17:41.860
and these are the operations that
you define for an "Applicative".

0:17:41.860,0:17:48.860
"pure" is like "return" and this
is a weaker thing than "bind"

0:17:54.270,0:17:56.400
So, remember we had

0:17:56.400,0:18:00.960
"fmap . fmap . fmap" up there

0:18:00.960,0:18:02.720
uh...

0:18:02.720,0:18:05.230
uh... we can define

0:18:05.230,0:18:07.600
we could take the definition of "fmapDefault"

0:18:07.600,0:18:09.810
and we if we ripped out "traverse" here..

0:18:09.810,0:18:13.610
If we didn't make this use the "Traversable" class..

0:18:13.610,0:18:16.980
If we passed this in as an argument..

0:18:16.980,0:18:21.740
What Traversal I want to use

0:18:21.740,0:18:27.670
I could make a function that looks a lot like "fmapDefault".

0:18:27.670,0:18:35.419
We'll call it "over" -- I have "under" and
some other ones that are related as well.

0:18:35.419,0:18:40.290
and then if we look at the definition of
"over traverse f"

0:18:40.290,0:18:43.090
this is going to turn into 

0:18:43.090,0:18:45.560
"runIdentity . traverse (Identity . f)"

0:18:45.560,0:18:48.660
but we know this is just the definition
of "fmapDefault"

0:18:48.660,0:18:51.980
and "fmapDefault" is a valid definition of "fmap"

0:18:51.980,0:18:54.580
so "over traverse"

0:18:54.580,0:19:01.010
is effectively going to the same amount
of work as "fmap"

0:19:01.010,0:19:04.760
and if we give this thing a signature

0:19:04.760,0:19:07.530
uh... we're going to be able to go from

0:19:07.530,0:19:11.450
"(a -> Identity b) -> s -> Identity t"

0:19:11.450,0:19:14.260
to a function from "(a -> b)" to "(s -> t)".

0:19:14.260,0:19:16.760
This is a semantic editor combinator.

0:19:16.760,0:19:18.539
This is something I don't know.

0:19:18.539,0:19:20.270
this could be true

0:19:20.270,0:19:21.550
this could be

0:19:21.550,0:19:23.410
um...

0:19:23.410,0:19:27.160
the signature of "traverse".
[Audience: are those parentheses unbalanced?]

0:19:27.160,0:19:29.530
What's that?

0:19:29.530,0:19:31.890
you can be put parens around this chunk..

0:19:31.890,0:19:34.880
Oh! I missed a paren over here.
Yes, I screwed up

0:19:34.880,0:19:41.880
This should have a parenthesis. Here.

0:19:43.450,0:19:44.550
So

0:19:44.550,0:19:52.610
we'll call this type here, a "Setter" for right now.

0:19:52.610,0:19:56.830
And a setter lets me just update.
I can't..

0:19:56.830,0:19:59.150
uh...

0:19:59.150,0:20:01.150
I can't do certain other things to it yet.

0:20:01.150,0:20:06.300
But a "Setter" can be used to generalize
this "fmap . fmap . fmap" chain

0:20:06.300,0:20:12.700
just like semantic editor combinators did originally.

0:20:12.700,0:20:15.530
So let's make up something to build a "Setter".

0:20:15.530,0:20:19.000
We'll make a function named "mapped",

0:20:19.000,0:20:23.760
because "fmap" wasn't a "Setter".
It was a semantic editor combinator.

0:20:23.760,0:20:25.030
Right? it had the..

0:20:25.030,0:20:25.860
it was the..

0:20:25.860,0:20:28.299
"(a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)"

0:20:28.299,0:20:31.780
but it didn't have a um..

0:20:31.780,0:20:37.640
"Identity" mucking things up.

0:20:37.640,0:20:41.360
"mapped" basically just bolts the "Identity" in.

0:20:41.360,0:20:43.370
and then if we lookat "over mapped f"

0:20:43.370,0:20:47.640
this is "runIdentity . mapped (Identity . f)"

0:20:47.640,0:20:50.770
but we can expand the definition of "mapped"

0:20:50.770,0:20:56.860
so this becomes
"runIdentity . Identity . fmap (runIdentity . Identity . f)"

0:20:56.860,0:21:00.450
so we can collapse the "runIdentity . Identity"s and we just
get fmap.

0:21:00.450,0:21:06.299
so we can see that "over mapped" is "fmap"
and "over traverse" is "fmap".

0:21:06.299,0:21:11.570
So you can pass this thing "mapped", which would work
for any "Functor" or we can pass
would work for any bunker or we can pass

0:21:11.570,0:21:13.770
it "traverse"

0:21:13.770,0:21:15.590
or really anything that

0:21:15.590,0:21:18.330
I'll call a "Traversal" in a few minutes.

0:21:18.330,0:21:22.280
So we can we can just passed this
function anything liked "mapped".

0:21:22.280,0:21:25.270
or "mapped . mapped"

0:21:25.270,0:21:27.430
and it will just work

0:21:27.430,0:21:30.880
so any any "Setter" that i can construct

0:21:30.880,0:21:32.620
I can pass to "mapped"!

0:21:32.620,0:21:39.240
And "traverse" can be made to be a "Setter"
by just picking the "Functor", because

0:21:39.240,0:21:41.799
we're allowed to pick any "Functor" we want..

0:21:41.799,0:21:44.779
er.. any "Applicative" we want.
We'll just pick the "Applicative" to be "Identity".

0:21:44.779,0:21:51.779
Right? The type system will do that for us when
we go to pass it in to something that expected
to pass it into something that expects a Setter.

0:21:54.240,0:21:56.490
So that gave us

0:21:56.490,0:21:58.910
the ability to

0:21:58.910,0:21:59.679
walk into something

0:21:59.679,0:22:02.150
so

0:22:02.150,0:22:03.960
but um...

0:22:03.960,0:22:08.580
lets maybe use that

0:22:08.580,0:22:11.409
himself, so "over mapped" add one to every element in this list.

0:22:11.409,0:22:15.280
that once you have really been the
slowest

0:22:15.280,0:22:20.700
ignore the uh... laundry list of the modules loaded there..

0:22:20.700,0:22:30.799
Well maybe I want to say "over (mapped . mapped)"..

0:22:31.870,0:22:41.600
but notice that this -- unlike the lens 
library that we described at the
beginning of this -- that we can actually

0:22:43.500,0:22:45.840
change types here.

0:22:45.840,0:22:51.820
So my lenses can actually go in many structures deep
change out the types and pull them back out. er..


0:22:51.820,0:22:55.110
I'm not actually using mapped as a lens, this is a "Setter"
still.

0:22:55.110,0:23:01.100
but setters can still be used to change types.

0:23:01.100,0:23:04.510
so i said.. everywhere inside this thing

0:23:04.510,0:23:06.100
where i'm going two levels deep

0:23:06.100,0:23:08.090
you know mapping through structures

0:23:08.090,0:23:14.910
go through and compute the length of
each of those strings

0:23:14.910,0:23:16.809
I just wanted to motivate this

0:23:16.809,0:23:19.559
with a little bit of an example.

0:23:19.559,0:23:23.419
Because, we've been talking a lot of theory for a while here.

0:23:23.419,0:23:27.290
So we can make lots of these things..
like if i had "Data.Text".

0:23:27.290,0:23:29.990
"Data.Text" is now what you'd traditionally think of
as a 'Functor".

0:23:29.990,0:23:32.180
It is not a container.

0:23:32.180,0:23:35.130
in the classic sense that it's
polymorphic and what what it can hold

0:23:35.130,0:23:37.950
It can only hold characters.

0:23:37.950,0:23:41.330
but we can make a "Setter"

0:23:41.330,0:23:44.170
for the characters in a "String"

0:23:44.170,0:23:46.760
er.. in "Data.Text"

0:23:46.760,0:23:48.340
um.. so you say

0:23:48.340,0:23:50.870
if we unpack this thing, now we've got a string..

0:23:50.870,0:23:52.559
let's go map over the string

0:23:52.559,0:23:55.730
and then pack it back up

0:23:55.730,0:23:57.410
uh... and this

0:23:57.410,0:23:59.769
matches our definition for a Setter

0:23:59.769,0:24:01.870
and "over chars" will

0:24:01.870,0:24:06.320
go in and do the right thing.
And we can go into lists of characters

0:24:06.320,0:24:07.460
or

0:24:07.460,0:24:11.880
any "Traversable" container holding other
characters

0:24:11.880,0:24:13.080
er.. holding onto

0:24:13.080,0:24:14.250
"Text" fragments.

0:24:14.250,0:24:15.680
And we can map over each

0:24:15.680,0:24:17.560
of the characters inside of

0:24:17.560,0:24:24.560
my containers full of containers.

0:24:25.899,0:24:28.600
By the way? How readable is this?

0:24:28.600,0:24:31.680
I should have asked that,
probably a long time ago.

0:24:31.680,0:24:38.680
This is a lot of small text. I apologize.

0:24:40.310,0:24:44.580
So derived from the "Functor" laws

0:24:44.580,0:24:47.060
..I think i can zoom..

0:24:47.060,0:24:49.880
..Control-zoom.. yay!..

0:24:49.880,0:24:52.270
so if we look at the "Functor" laws

0:24:52.270,0:24:54.799
that "fmap id = id".

0:24:54.799,0:24:59.520
and "fmap f . fmap g = fmap (f . g)"

0:24:59.520,0:25:00.420
um...

0:25:00.420,0:25:04.450
in in the in the case of "Functor" you
can actually derive the second law from the first
and parametricity.

0:25:04.450,0:25:06.600
uh... in the case of "Setters" you can't.

0:25:06.600,0:25:09.120
You.. you don't get this one for free, unfortunately.

0:25:09.120,0:25:09.940
uh...

0:25:09.940,0:25:14.100
we can make analogous laws for setters that we would
like to have hold.

0:25:14.100,0:25:18.289
they say that if you go "over" a setter with "id"

0:25:18.289,0:25:21.740
it should be the identity.

0:25:21.740,0:25:24.940
and if you go over it with "f" and over it with "g"

0:25:24.940,0:25:29.590
it's the same as going over it with the composition.

0:25:29.590,0:25:33.960
but we can make setters that don't look anything like

0:25:33.960,0:25:37.549
uh...

0:25:37.549,0:25:39.450
a valid "Functor".

0:25:39.450,0:25:45.299
like here I'm going to walk over both halves of a pair.

0:25:45.299,0:25:49.360
Here you can give me a pair where the the two sides match in type and

0:25:49.360,0:25:56.279
I'll give you a new pair were the sides match in type as long as you
give me a function from "a" to "b".

0:25:56.279,0:26:00.799
and I have to sprinkle the "Applicative" sugar through that

0:26:00.799,0:26:05.010
uh... or i can walk over the first element of this, so

0:26:05.010,0:26:08.220
given a pair of an "a" and a "c"

0:26:08.220,0:26:12.250
uh... if you want a "b" and a "c",
give me a function from "a" to "b".

0:26:12.250,0:26:14.470
and i'll give you

0:26:14.470,0:26:21.470
a function from "(a,c)" to "(b,c)".

0:26:26.929,0:26:30.000
and we can actually see that in use over
here

0:26:30.000,0:26:32.740
so if I want to go in here..

0:26:32.740,0:26:39.740
and say..

0:26:41.200,0:26:45.070
sorry for my colorful example..

0:26:45.070,0:26:46.110
there. um...

0:26:46.110,0:26:50.080
so now we're going into a list

0:26:50.080,0:26:53.730
and then into the pairs inside that list
where the types of the

0:26:53.730,0:26:56.810
two halves of the pair have to match originally

0:26:56.810,0:26:58.960
and then they'll match in the output.

0:26:58.960,0:27:02.840
and here I'm passing in a function from "String -> Int"

0:27:02.840,0:27:05.429
and i'm getting out

0:27:05.429,0:27:10.800
a list of pairs of ints.

0:27:10.800,0:27:17.800
and we can of course do this in a smaller setting as well.

0:27:23.470,0:27:27.280
So there are lots of combinators for working with setters.
I'm just throwing them up here

0:27:27.280,0:27:32.090
sort of like a scare slide I admit.

0:27:32.090,0:27:33.930
The substance of it is is that

0:27:33.930,0:27:38.800
you can construct a "Setter" from a
semantic editor combinator or from a functor.

0:27:38.800,0:27:41.350
uh... you can..

0:27:41.350,0:27:45.490
You can actually use "traverse" directly as a "Setter".
We saw that early on.

0:27:45.490,0:27:48.539
uh... there's lots of combinators for working with them:
"over" ..

0:27:48.539,0:27:52.590
There is an infix version of "over" that is convenient
in a lot of code.

0:27:52.590,0:27:53.490
um...

0:27:53.490,0:27:57.760
and then if you're used to just doing
things like "+=", and "*=" and

0:27:57.760,0:28:00.380
those kinds of things inside of imperative code..

0:28:00.380,0:28:02.770
if you are working in a state monad..

0:28:02.770,0:28:04.880
and your state

0:28:04.880,0:28:06.900
is something that you have a lens into

0:28:06.900,0:28:12.809
you can do (+=) to modify part of that state

0:28:12.809,0:28:16.380
That will modify *all* the targets for
the setter inside of the inside of your state.

0:28:16.380,0:28:20.280
So is actually more powerful than the
(+=) notion that you are used to in imperative code,

0:28:20.280,0:28:24.000
because it can hit multiple targets.

0:28:24.000,0:28:26.970
um...

0:28:26.970,0:28:30.720
This (%=) is something where

0:28:30.720,0:28:34.560
if you think about it as "mod" like an imperative programmer.
This is mod-equals, right? Thats why..

0:28:34.560,0:28:36.860
it's a modifying it with a function

0:28:36.860,0:28:37.830
um...

0:28:37.830,0:28:40.179
it's.. it was named for a pun

0:28:40.179,0:28:44.700
it at least gave me some mnemonic for what
what the modify thing should be.

0:28:44.700,0:28:46.909
um...

0:28:46.909,0:28:51.260
and we can we can "set" or directly just
change the value to its new target

0:28:51.260,0:28:58.880
This is like passing it "const b"
for this function instead of

0:28:58.880,0:29:01.190
passing it an arbitrary function.

0:29:01.190,0:29:02.870
there's lots of thing to do with it

0:29:02.870,0:29:06.789
Setters I think make a nice entry point
to the library because they hint

0:29:06.789,0:29:09.290
at the structure that we want

0:29:09.290,0:29:12.950
We got them directly by looking at
the definition of "fmapDefault" that was already

0:29:12.950,0:29:15.810
there -- that was defined for us inside of

0:29:15.810,0:29:17.840
"Data.Traversable"

0:29:17.840,0:29:20.790
um...

0:29:20.790,0:29:25.169
We stole the laws wholesale from "Functor".
We didn't have to make up laws for setters.

0:29:25.169,0:29:26.920
They were already given to us.

0:29:26.920,0:29:27.999
by the sort of

0:29:27.999,0:29:34.999
canonical choice of what a Setter should look like, 
which is Functor.

0:29:35.649,0:29:38.510
So lets do Traversals.

0:29:38.510,0:29:43.080
So we saw that we could pass "traverse" as
a "Setter".

0:29:43.080,0:29:44.649
What if we

0:29:44.649,0:29:50.700
tried to generalize _this_ pattern
instead of just generalizing "fmap . fmap . fmap .."

0:29:50.700,0:29:54.669
Lets do "traverse" and "traverse . traverse".

0:29:54.669,0:30:02.350
Because, remember, "over traverse f" gave us "fmap f".

0:30:02.350,0:30:05.630
We might we might be able to find "mapM" in terms of traverse.

0:30:05.630,0:30:11.130
Actually, mapM is defined in terms of "traverse"
inside "Data.Traversable".

0:30:11.130,0:30:13.260
but for the default definition of "mapM"

0:30:13.260,0:30:15.940
they use this "WrapMonad" and "unwrapMonad"

0:30:15.940,0:30:16.990
This is a newtype. They are

0:30:16.990,0:30:19.029
the putting on and taking it off.

0:30:19.029,0:30:22.940
Here this guy says, given a Monad for "m"

0:30:22.940,0:30:27.010
I'll give you an "Applicative" for "WrapMonad m"

0:30:27.010,0:30:30.650
okay and since i've got an "Applicative" I
can go through "traverse" and now that I've gone through "traverse"

0:30:30.650,0:30:37.429
I can pull the "WrappedMonad" off and I'll have done the work.

0:30:37.429,0:30:41.970
Using that same pattern of just pulling 

0:30:41.970,0:30:42.880
um...

0:30:42.880,0:30:47.000
the "traverse" out of this definition and
replacing it with an argument

0:30:47.000,0:30:52.470
we can get a similar definition for "mapM"

0:30:52.470,0:30:54.880
that takes the "Traversal".

0:30:54.880,0:30:57.590
and so the says if you give me an "s"

0:30:57.590,0:31:01.130
and any monadic function from "a -> m b"

0:31:01.130,0:31:02.509
i'll give you an "m t".

0:31:02.509,0:31:03.980
given a "Traversal" 

0:31:03.980,0:31:06.290
the goes from "s" to "t" and given

0:31:06.290,0:31:08.580
function from "a" to "m b" for any

0:31:08.580,0:31:12.679
monadic or applicative side effect you want.

0:31:12.679,0:31:15.509
so "mapMOf" could be defined

0:31:15.509,0:31:16.750
in terms of

0:31:16.750,0:31:18.710
our "Traversal", just by

0:31:18.710,0:31:23.490
pulling traverse out of the function

0:31:23.490,0:31:26.000
and so now "over traverse f" gave us "fmap f"

0:31:26.000,0:31:28.320
but "mapMOf traverse"

0:31:28.320,0:31:31.730
give us "unwrapMonad . traverse (WrapMonad . f)"
which is exactly

0:31:31.730,0:31:34.900
the definition of "mapM" above.

0:31:34.900,0:31:37.970
So we can see that we've generalized the existing notion of "mapM"

0:31:37.970,0:31:42.809
by just pulling out the "Traversable".

0:31:42.809,0:31:46.430
and there are laws that we already know for "Data.Travesable"

0:31:46.430,0:31:51.259
The "Traversable" laws are just these:

0:31:51.259,0:31:59.710
"traverse pure = pure" and 
"Compose . fmap (traverse f) . traverse g = traverse (Compose f . g)"

0:31:59.710,0:32:03.260
Now, in the end of the slides I have some
references, Jeremy Gibbons wrote

0:32:03.260,0:32:08.230
a very wonderful paper on
"The Essence of the Iterator Pattern"

0:32:08.230,0:32:10.490
In the process of working on this

0:32:10.490,0:32:12.730
with Russell O'Connor

0:32:12.730,0:32:17.090
He was able to prove that these
are all of the laws that you need!

0:32:17.090,0:32:19.920
There were a couple side conditions
that were floating around in

0:32:19.920,0:32:21.149
"The Essence of the Iterator Pattern"

0:32:21.149,0:32:24.660
Those turned out to all be consequences
of those laws.

0:32:24.660,0:32:28.419
There's a paper he's been putting together

0:32:28.419,0:32:31.670
that actually goes through with the formal
proof of this in Coq showing that all

0:32:31.670,0:32:34.960
traversals are finitary containers.

0:32:34.960,0:32:37.130
um...

0:32:37.130,0:32:40.660
So this spun off a little bit of research!

0:32:40.660,0:32:44.810
But the laws for a "Traversal" are just these. Just
rip out "traverse" and replace it with "l".

0:32:44.810,0:32:47.179
so a valid "Traversal" "l"

0:32:47.179,0:32:49.710
"l pure" should be "pure"

0:32:49.710,0:32:52.860
uh...

0:32:52.860,0:32:54.690
and if pure was Identity you could see

0:32:54.690,0:32:58.929
how this gives the Functor law.

0:32:58.929,0:33:03.470
and "Compose . fmap (l f) . " etcetera

0:33:03.470,0:33:06.330
That one is a little bit ugly, its inside
Jeremy Gibbons' paper

0:33:06.330,0:33:09.080
uh.. if you want more motivation.

0:33:09.080,0:33:12.510
But really what this guy is saying is
that your traversal doesn't change the

0:33:12.510,0:33:14.870
number of targets for the next traversal.

0:33:14.870,0:33:17.560
so if you apply a traversal,

0:33:17.560,0:33:19.860
and you traversed seven elements

0:33:19.860,0:33:21.690
the next traversal

0:33:21.690,0:33:25.010
if you were to apply the same traversal
would have to see seven elements again

0:33:25.010,0:33:33.130
That's a good litmus test of
whether or not you have a legal traversal

0:33:33.130,0:33:35.299
uh...

0:33:35.299,0:33:42.240
So we've got lots of traversals. Um..
"traverse" is a "Traversal"!

0:33:42.240,0:33:44.910
(let's see if i pan this correctly)

0:33:44.910,0:33:48.000
uh... "both", which we saw earlier

0:33:48.000,0:33:50.740
we wrote both as a "Setter" originally, all right?

0:33:50.740,0:33:54.590
but we were just using arbitrary "Applicative",

0:33:54.590,0:33:57.140
so both can be a traversal.

0:33:57.140,0:34:01.200
We can traverse the "Left" half of an "Either".

0:34:01.200,0:34:02.960
instead of having to "traverse" the "Right".

0:34:02.960,0:34:07.919
Well we don't even have the instance of "Traversable"
for "Either", so..

0:34:07.919,0:34:11.969
oops. I think I was supposed to write that.
(I should do that)

0:34:11.969,0:34:15.589
But in the meantime you can use a traversal!

0:34:15.589,0:34:16.430
uh...

0:34:16.430,0:34:19.230
actually these are called "_left" and
"_right" and they are actually

0:34:19.230,0:34:21.029
more general than this

0:34:21.029,0:34:24.919
in the actual lens library

0:34:24.919,0:34:30.769
but then we can come down here and say
"over _left (+1) (Left 3)"

0:34:30.769,0:34:34.459
but if I gave that guy "Right 3" it would
just leave it alone

0:34:34.459,0:34:38.579
If I gave it (Right "hello") it wouldn't
care about the type not matching, yeah.

0:34:38.579,0:34:43.489
It is only looking for the type on the "Left".

0:34:43.489,0:34:44.789
uh...

0:34:44.789,0:34:48.559
and if we compose these things it'll
walk into the left half of an "Either"

0:34:48.559,0:34:50.789
there and then into both.

0:34:50.789,0:34:52.759
also notice something here, though.

0:34:52.759,0:34:56.519
the order of composition here is
I'm going into this structure

0:34:56.519,0:35:03.519
and then into this one!
The order reads left to right and not right to left.

0:35:03.659,0:35:07.899
and that will be really useful in a minute

0:35:07.899,0:35:11.289
because of the ordinary an
imperative programmer would kind of expect

0:35:11.289,0:35:13.209
field acccessors to go, you know?

0:35:13.209,0:35:20.159
I'm accessing "foo.bar.baz.quux" and adding ten.

0:35:20.159,0:35:22.469
So,

0:35:22.469,0:35:29.469
If i said

0:35:31.319,0:35:34.210
uh... (&) here is just "flip ($)".

0:35:34.210,0:35:39.159
It makes for cute syntax. [laughter]

0:35:39.159,0:35:44.989
I could've written this thing with.. 
Right?

0:35:44.989,0:35:53.059
And "_2" is a very interestingly named
operator for basically "snd" as a lens.

0:35:53.059,0:35:56.039
uh... we have them up to "_9". They are
actually polymorphic you can work with them

0:35:56.039,0:35:57.459
on

0:35:57.459,0:35:59.819
arbitrarily large tuples (up to 9)

0:35:59.819,0:36:00.969
um...

0:36:00.969,0:36:07.969
they just do the right thing

0:36:07.969,0:36:20.749
[.. A long, mostly inaudible question from
Jay Sulzberger about the inability of Haskell
to express naturals at the type level..]

0:36:20.749,0:36:26.419
We do have these around now, but..

0:36:26.419,0:36:28.770
but it but it's very hard to correlate
those two

0:36:28.770,0:36:30.149
it is very hard to program

0:36:30.149,0:36:32.509
polymorphically over arbitrary sized tuples.

0:36:32.509,0:36:34.680
We don't have a k-tuple, where the kth tuple is
indexed by n.

0:36:34.680,0:36:40.939
[Jay: That'll be in the next version]

0:36:40.939,0:36:41.809
[laughter]

0:36:41.809,0:36:43.939
Maybe.

0:36:43.939,0:36:50.019
Well, we'll have type level naturals anyways.

0:36:50.019,0:36:52.219
So let's let's us go through and edit part of the structure.

0:36:52.219,0:36:53.109
So,

0:36:53.109,0:36:56.709
The nice thing about building up..

0:36:56.709,0:36:58.299
in this order

0:36:58.299,0:37:05.299
is that if i start here

0:37:05.449,0:37:06.390
i can

0:37:06.390,0:37:09.429
start with say a blank record

0:37:09.429,0:37:13.459
and now it looks like build up a record
by setting this field equal to this value

0:37:13.459,0:37:14.989
and this field equal to that value

0:37:14.989,0:37:20.119
Right? you can actually read it off

0:37:20.119,0:37:21.919
um...

0:37:21.919,0:37:24.979
and that this works for arbitrary

0:37:24.979,0:37:28.729
setters or traversals or

0:37:28.729,0:37:30.979
lenses as we'll see. heh..

0:37:30.979,0:37:33.379
they'll all just.. they'll all just work

0:37:33.379,0:37:37.039
uh... One a main goals of the
lens library has been to make it so that

0:37:37.039,0:37:39.489
whenever you reach for any combinator

0:37:39.489,0:37:42.199
and almost any type that you think it
could work with

0:37:42.199,0:37:45.769
it should "do it" and it should do the right thing.

0:37:45.769,0:37:47.119
uh...

0:37:47.119,0:37:48.459
and it it worked out

0:37:48.459,0:37:51.749
pleasantly by accident,
but it worked out really well!

0:37:51.749,0:37:54.999
uh... so we've been trying to
maintain that property

0:37:54.999,0:37:56.739
so..

0:37:56.739,0:37:59.749
if we go "over (traverseLeft.both)" ..

0:37:59.749,0:38:02.169
we'll be able to walk into

0:38:02.169,0:38:05.679
all of that.

0:38:05.679,0:38:08.759
So, those are Traversals.

0:38:08.759,0:38:12.039
There is a whole host of combinators for working with Traversals.

0:38:12.039,0:38:14.879
In "Data.Traversable" there is a whole bunch of combinators
for working with any Traversable container.

0:38:14.879,0:38:18.369
If you take any of the combinators that are in there

0:38:18.369,0:38:21.359
and bolt "Of" on the end of the name of it
it

0:38:21.359,0:38:23.989
you can pass it a

0:38:23.989,0:38:28.199
Traversal directly and it will work
with any traversal you've written.

0:38:28.199,0:38:32.619
uh... and so that means that i wrote a
_traversal_ now, for traversing

0:38:32.619,0:38:35.149
the characters in Data.Text..

0:38:35.149,0:38:42.709
If you look in the API for Data.Text,
it duplicates almost the entire Prelude 
for everything that deals with a list!

0:38:42.709,0:38:45.940
But most of those combinators are things you
could derive from Traversable

0:38:45.940,0:38:49.369
if it was an actual "Traversable" instance.

0:38:49.369,0:38:54.359
and so what this lets me do a shrink the API

0:38:54.359,0:38:58.869
for working with Text down to more or
less two functions..

0:38:58.869,0:39:04.149
and a bunch of combinators that work
with everything.

0:39:04.149,0:39:08.629
So if you are looking for the
selling point of this, its that

0:39:08.629,0:39:12.069
APIs like Data.Text are wonderful.
They are really high-performance.

0:39:12.069,0:39:13.409
They work really well.

0:39:13.409,0:39:16.349
But they don't feel very Haskelly.
You have to import a module..

0:39:16.349,0:39:21.689
but you have to import it qualified
because all the names collide with 
everything else from the Prelude.

0:39:21.689,0:39:26.629
With this, the API for working with Data.Text is
compatible with the API for working with everything else.

0:39:26.629,0:39:29.380
You don't have to import anything
qualified in order to work with these

0:39:29.380,0:39:31.569
text fragments.

0:39:31.569,0:39:38.569
um... and it really cleans up
the code that results.

0:39:41.399,0:39:44.739
I an actually show that off.

0:39:44.739,0:39:46.130
load Data.Text

0:39:46.130,0:39:48.849
and load..

0:39:48.849,0:39:52.089
a little helper library

0:39:52.089,0:39:54.189
and say if i had

0:39:54.189,0:39:56.119
hello, packed

0:39:56.119,0:39:59.349
I'm going to use syntax I haven't introduced yet. I apologize.

0:39:59.349,0:40:01.649
If I look at that.

0:40:01.649,0:40:03.409
this is Text.

0:40:03.409,0:40:05.129
I'm saying use

0:40:05.129,0:40:11.239
something to read out

0:40:11.239,0:40:12.460
from a list, so that gave me Text.

0:40:12.460,0:40:15.829
and i could go through and say well if
any of..

0:40:15.829,0:40:18.269
the text characters

0:40:18.269,0:40:21.959
are equal to 'c' in

0:40:21.959,0:40:27.649
[Audience member: can you zoom in?]

0:40:27.649,0:40:29.379
I totally can..

0:40:29.379,0:40:30.619
Well, that made it worse

0:40:30.619,0:40:31.919
eh...

0:40:31.919,0:40:35.809
that's about as good as I can go. That work?

0:40:35.809,0:40:38.439
so "anyOf text (=='c')"

0:40:38.439,0:40:42.129
and "hello", hrmm. that was a little too small.

0:40:42.129,0:40:49.129
uh...

0:40:51.289,0:40:53.769
I lost myself.

0:40:53.769,0:40:57.839
I can at least put it on the screen now.

0:40:57.839,0:41:04.839
and:
anyOf text (=='c') ("chello"^.packed)

0:41:08.019,0:41:11.349
and this works

0:41:11.349,0:41:13.679
in "both.text"

0:41:13.679,0:41:19.979
if i had..

0:41:19.979,0:41:22.059
if I worked with "chello world"

0:41:22.059,0:41:26.559
we can walk into
characters that are inside of

0:41:26.559,0:41:30.399
a pair of Text fragments

0:41:30.399,0:41:32.079
and "anyOf"..

0:41:32.079,0:41:35.539
"any" is a combinator in "Data.Foldable"

0:41:35.539,0:41:40.509
uh... I'm jumping all over the place.

0:41:40.509,0:41:43.050
[Audience member: Does this work with fusion in Data.Text?]
Uh... no

0:41:43.050,0:41:45.849
You get a beautiful API.. and you lose all your fusion! [laughter]

0:41:45.849,0:41:48.959
That is the price. um..

0:41:48.959,0:41:53.599
Data.Text is very very performance
conscious and if you really want

0:41:53.599,0:41:57.799
maintain that performance consciousness
you probably have to use

0:41:57.799,0:42:00.859
qualified imports, but if you just wanted to
munge some Text around..

0:42:00.859,0:42:06.439
and you already have the rest of this
stuff open

0:42:06.439,0:42:10.369
it can in practice be quite useful.

0:42:10.369,0:42:14.299
so if I zoom back out..

0:42:14.299,0:42:17.329
"anyOf" actually doesn't need "Traversable"
in needs

0:42:17.329,0:42:20.489
"Foldable"

0:42:20.489,0:42:25.479
When.. when I introduced Traversable
I glossed over one of its ancestors.

0:42:25.479,0:42:27.209
and that is that

0:42:27.209,0:42:31.619
Foldable bassically provides you with

make that distinction

0:46:10.899,0:46:12.930
constand is always a popular

he's the actor

don't care what we should be made

0:47:14.629,0:47:16.889
because the act

0:47:16.889,0:47:21.869

0:47:23.509,0:47:24.520
and b

0:47:24.520,0:47:31.520
down and the unending

0:47:31.789,0:47:33.289
all napa all

0:47:33.289,0:47:35.419
is defined in terms of traverse

0:47:35.419,0:47:38.669
we've kind of established a pattern for
what we do grip on tunes that look like

0:47:38.669,0:47:40.839
that though

0:47:40.839,0:47:43.869
um...

0:47:43.869,0:47:44.640
so

0:47:44.640,0:47:46.679
and you're right lou

0:47:46.679,0:47:51.349
stupidly dance again

0:47:51.349,0:47:54.049
so taken bold not default we debate
apart

0:47:54.049,0:47:55.889
we can pull traverse out of there

0:47:55.889,0:47:57.619
replace it with

0:47:57.619,0:48:00.699
something local health for the past it

to get your is

0:48:04.400,0:48:07.689
and it will give us a signature that
works

0:48:07.689,0:48:10.599
right uh... i didn't have to make
anything out

0:48:10.599,0:48:16.029
beautiful view it should be

0:48:16.029,0:48:17.919
we can make op

0:48:17.919,0:48:19.699
kelly when we did

0:48:19.699,0:48:22.779
uh...

0:48:22.779,0:48:27.049
when we work with setters we we don't
math so that over maps turned into act

0:48:27.049,0:48:30.119
up

0:48:30.119,0:48:33.779
i want some things that i can pass it so
that when pulled up others applied to

0:48:33.779,0:48:35.839
say folded

0:48:35.839,0:48:37.670
this should be

0:48:37.670,0:48:40.659
would you give this issue resolved for
that matter

0:48:40.659,0:48:42.089
what are the same thing

0:48:42.089,0:48:43.989
which was there for the cost

0:48:43.989,0:48:48.169
might characterize

0:48:48.169,0:48:50.770
so pulled map of was kept constant

0:48:50.770,0:48:52.929
that alcohol so that

0:48:52.929,0:48:56.139
if i choose folded to be const

0:48:56.139,0:48:58.989
that bold map i'll get on startup

0:48:58.989,0:49:01.899
then paul bappa folded

0:49:01.899,0:49:05.169
turns in to get cast of const

0:49:05.169,0:49:09.289
appalled that will get past that kant

0:49:09.289,0:49:12.459
and we can destroy these two

0:49:12.459,0:49:17.199
defcon stuck aunts

0:49:17.199,0:49:20.699
has become sport bab

0:49:20.699,0:49:24.309
we've gone through the relation we've
proven that this is

0:49:24.309,0:49:26.209
you know sort of the

0:49:26.209,0:49:27.430
deeper

0:49:27.430,0:49:30.029
folders at work

0:49:30.029,0:49:32.739
and given any folder

0:49:32.739,0:49:36.219
weekend begin to find the stamina vocal
view

0:49:36.219,0:49:37.719
and bureau says

0:49:37.719,0:49:39.909
i'm just gonna pass

0:49:39.909,0:49:45.069
const

0:49:45.069,0:49:50.549
and you can now get cut

0:49:50.549,0:49:53.149
going back to abusing things averages
jet

0:49:53.149,0:49:54.099
uh...

0:49:54.099,0:49:55.709
why do you want out of

0:49:55.709,0:50:02.709
hello

0:50:05.179,0:50:08.840
uh... yes older not

0:50:08.840,0:50:13.390
uh... yeah

0:50:13.390,0:50:20.339
cook

0:50:20.339,0:50:21.989
review folded

0:50:21.989,0:50:24.989
will say if you give me any foldable
half

0:50:24.989,0:50:27.329
and a model a big

0:50:27.329,0:50:29.970
uh... and i'm gonna give you another
horrible projector

0:50:29.970,0:50:31.779
uh... i'll give you a day

0:50:31.779,0:50:32.940
a pontoon from

0:50:32.940,0:50:35.699
appleby two b

0:50:35.699,0:50:38.259
you're looking at

0:50:38.259,0:50:41.569
generalize to use that word of

0:50:41.569,0:50:44.679
uh... that the actual documentation for
this is really nice thing to do about

0:50:44.679,0:50:48.539
ten makes type signatures you can look
at the u_s_ having

0:50:48.539,0:50:49.719
think about it

0:50:49.719,0:50:54.859
um...

0:50:54.859,0:50:56.689
bone review bolded

0:50:56.689,0:50:59.319
uh... their inside of data that uh...
uh...

0:50:59.319,0:51:01.090
foldable invincible double

0:51:01.090,0:51:04.530
their their sport map there's all are
others walking generalization for the

0:51:04.530,0:51:07.039
common or video

0:51:07.039,0:51:10.479
and one of them is called for the masses
basically saying if you have all

0:51:10.479,0:51:14.699
a container full of my moral values

0:51:14.699,0:51:17.159
i'm going to

0:51:17.159,0:51:19.849
uh...

0:51:19.849,0:51:21.679
what u

0:51:21.679,0:51:25.769
like calculate a mno some basic level
like just the stitch decision together

0:51:25.769,0:51:27.269
with one of the notebook

0:51:27.269,0:51:32.589
the action has been a model

0:51:32.589,0:51:34.149
so we got a few folded

0:51:34.149,0:51:36.549
this is going to turn in to get concert
on support that

0:51:36.549,0:51:38.019
because icons

0:51:38.019,0:51:39.990
this is called navid which is

0:51:39.990,0:51:43.689
e ful

0:51:43.689,0:51:47.609
and we can make up this guy will call up
the odd couple there's going to say

0:51:47.609,0:51:51.619
that for any choice of m you pick any

0:51:51.619,0:51:53.149
this is missing a monitor

0:51:53.149,0:51:54.010
for all amb

0:51:54.010,0:51:56.789
such that there's a monogram

0:51:56.789,0:52:00.889
give me a a doubt const them of a i'll
give you a pampered asked the cost of

0:52:00.889,0:52:07.889
about

0:52:07.949,0:52:11.289
so thats

0:52:11.289,0:52:13.969
they nice way to work with

0:52:13.969,0:52:15.489
here so we can work with

0:52:15.489,0:52:20.029
uh... anything that we do have bid up
audible we can do with the pool

0:52:20.029,0:52:21.699
to like anne allen

0:52:21.699,0:52:23.809
some

0:52:23.809,0:52:26.569
product billable

0:52:26.569,0:52:30.319
fifty commenters however

0:52:30.319,0:52:34.439
um... they all general so some of both

0:52:34.439,0:52:35.569
will go through an adult

0:52:35.569,0:52:39.659
both on the toddler or some of traversed
upload will go through

0:52:39.659,0:52:42.199
some traversed will be there for
terrorist

0:52:42.199,0:52:44.410
in and out the values uh... all of the

0:52:44.410,0:52:45.739
both sides of the

0:52:45.739,0:52:47.179
workers' incentive

0:52:47.179,0:52:54.179
buzzword

0:52:55.929,0:52:58.359
what we want something that was

0:52:58.359,0:52:59.939
more powerful

0:52:59.939,0:53:04.349
than a traversed uh...

0:53:04.349,0:53:07.059
we look at the signature here

0:53:07.059,0:53:09.109
traverse all centerfold

0:53:09.109,0:53:12.239
we we're up we're up about
nation-building and a whole piles up on

0:53:12.239,0:53:14.409
this planet

0:53:14.409,0:53:17.029
um... brother diversion appalled map of

0:53:17.029,0:53:20.479
to list of says there's a great you give
me up

0:53:20.479,0:53:21.809
uh...

0:53:21.809,0:53:23.669
convert downward

0:53:23.669,0:53:27.179
i got underscore one which would walk
over the first applecare

0:53:27.179,0:53:28.819
i don't need it

0:53:28.819,0:53:31.189
all of the power of the traverse will
get

0:53:31.189,0:53:32.649
to result as that

0:53:32.649,0:53:35.689
you pick any applicable

0:53:35.689,0:53:40.599
and i have to be able to use fabio upon
the facts are

0:53:40.599,0:53:43.959
here i'm only using

0:53:43.959,0:53:47.059
here i don't care about them online

0:53:47.059,0:53:48.039
met met

0:53:48.039,0:53:52.079
you know i mean are you doing underusing
you are saying the beautiful before

0:53:52.079,0:53:54.609
but new mother cara bottom online

0:53:54.609,0:53:57.760
your al your your uh... your particular
pull

0:53:57.760,0:54:03.039
might care about them online

0:54:03.039,0:54:06.869
the sublet it might as well this code
without anything leaders on it i said do

0:54:06.869,0:54:08.919
you understand one out of ten

0:54:08.919,0:54:13.009
uh... out of a pair for the twenty will
just give me back ten

0:54:13.009,0:54:16.109
uh... without a model eight on the
continent

0:54:16.109,0:54:18.709
that will work

0:54:18.709,0:54:24.219
so i obviously missed something

0:54:24.219,0:54:28.089
so deadly fad

0:54:28.089,0:54:32.319
a couple of additional members this
hierarchy we can fill in the gap

0:54:32.319,0:54:34.289
so that we can make

0:54:34.289,0:54:36.189
the signatures purview

0:54:36.189,0:54:43.189
and the signature of to list um... you
know all the things that make sense

0:54:46.509,0:54:50.589
what we want your is elevens are lesser
said getting

0:54:50.589,0:54:51.559
would be

0:54:51.559,0:54:55.799
i'm gonna get out something i'll use
this particular model or this particular

0:54:55.799,0:54:59.669
confident that my

0:54:59.669,0:55:02.919
constructor it may not may not be
anomaly because i'd i'm nothing at work

0:55:02.919,0:55:08.079
training on items that he works for our

0:55:08.079,0:55:10.739
and i must say in a caused art

0:55:10.739,0:55:11.859
as to plans are

0:55:11.859,0:55:14.689
so i want some power from paul

0:55:14.689,0:55:18.669
again the ability to

0:55:18.669,0:55:20.149
um...

0:55:20.149,0:55:21.549
but with this in particular

0:55:21.549,0:55:26.369
and if we just wrote the signature of u
you would look like getting a out of

0:55:26.369,0:55:27.979
asking abt

0:55:27.979,0:55:29.469
survivors o

0:55:29.469,0:55:35.309
raspy eighty were saying they given upon
too from a to b i gave you

0:55:35.309,0:55:36.989
it

0:55:36.989,0:55:40.199
uh... nolte in beer completely
irrelevant

0:55:40.199,0:55:41.339
we don't care about them

0:55:41.339,0:55:44.319
was any of them so that we can actually
pathname

0:55:44.319,0:55:49.059
when things will get our and for the
summer

0:55:49.059,0:55:50.029
and

0:55:50.029,0:55:52.279
i'm gonna just past the sky const

0:55:52.279,0:55:57.149
susan allen to beat any const indeed

0:55:57.149,0:56:00.969
another's estimate as to constipated

0:56:00.969,0:56:04.149
it's like getting have that concept that
i could get the any

0:56:04.149,0:56:07.039
i packed in here so

0:56:07.039,0:56:08.839
gives me a lot

0:56:08.839,0:56:10.319
interview

0:56:10.319,0:56:12.549
didn't demand of my life

0:56:12.549,0:56:15.749
out of the elements of my

0:56:15.749,0:56:19.329
if you happen is that with the fall

0:56:19.329,0:56:21.399
will demand a model

0:56:21.399,0:56:26.549
because the says this work as long as
you you can become on a crab

0:56:26.549,0:56:29.939
but view itself doesn't demand a model

0:56:29.939,0:56:33.869
all mapa even doesn't banana market

0:56:33.869,0:56:37.979
right on doing a dime applying you're
probably going to vegas some value card

0:56:37.979,0:56:39.729
we'll call it um...

0:56:39.729,0:56:41.229
the convenient

0:56:41.229,0:56:43.129
but i'm i'm rapid advance

0:56:43.129,0:56:46.619
so i did was presenting his view as both
a function and

0:56:46.619,0:56:48.429
i'm getting the cars that i got

0:56:48.429,0:56:49.989
i'm getting

0:56:49.989,0:56:51.129
endeavour

0:56:51.129,0:56:54.129
it may or may not be a model

0:56:54.129,0:56:57.159
so i apply for map up to a fault

0:56:57.159,0:56:59.079
unlike the man

0:56:59.079,0:57:00.169
amato i don't know

0:57:00.169,0:57:02.829
but i fight together

0:57:02.829,0:57:03.839
journey

0:57:03.839,0:57:04.889
now

0:57:04.889,0:57:11.889
uh... i will not

0:57:13.039,0:57:16.829
so we get

0:57:16.829,0:57:19.039
is we can make

0:57:19.039,0:57:20.479
if centers

0:57:20.479,0:57:22.059
we have

0:57:22.059,0:57:23.869
getters are missing decker

0:57:23.869,0:57:30.869
that list

0:57:31.209,0:57:34.120
so we can do is we can make this notion
of a lands

0:57:34.120,0:57:38.250
the any traverse eliza valid getter and
i'm missing the point one three missing

0:57:38.250,0:57:40.829
jeter missing

0:57:40.829,0:57:42.649
um...

0:57:42.649,0:57:47.089
we read the definition of get extra tape

0:57:47.089,0:57:49.339
asking abt

0:57:49.339,0:57:51.029
yesterday

0:57:51.029,0:57:55.759
reports

0:57:55.759,0:57:58.439
results

0:57:58.439,0:58:02.429
even if a chilly conse parbe

0:58:02.429,0:58:09.429
i can give you an asteroids comets

0:58:11.809,0:58:15.259
so we can

0:58:15.259,0:58:18.919
the finest biology to v

0:58:18.919,0:58:20.289
were polled said

0:58:20.289,0:58:24.749
you can rely on the fact that i have a
model

0:58:24.749,0:58:27.309
alligator doesn't give you this

0:58:27.309,0:58:29.649
so you have your if this does work for
any

0:58:29.649,0:58:31.989
function who made a consular

0:58:31.989,0:58:35.119
which is just that there is a factor of
fun to be a bunch of eight r

0:58:35.119,0:58:39.709
idea punch mass start liking of nothing
about

0:58:39.709,0:58:43.359
if they can do anything about our i
can't put together in any meaningful way

0:58:43.359,0:58:44.380
so i had to do is

0:58:44.380,0:58:45.380
fine

0:58:45.380,0:58:48.219
the won the hearts out of here

0:58:48.219,0:58:49.559
structure that this represent

0:58:49.559,0:58:56.559
this is a fancy way to say that i have a
function for mass today

0:58:59.589,0:59:02.089
though i have

0:59:02.089,0:59:04.399
uh... governor skipper ornaments lights
right

0:59:04.399,0:59:05.679
so i gather

0:59:05.679,0:59:11.519
is unified request and i will give you a
better

0:59:11.519,0:59:13.209
which is that for all our

0:59:13.209,0:59:18.179
itic onstar

0:59:18.179,0:59:20.699
and we can build too

0:59:20.699,0:59:24.059
and this guy says if you have lunch from
este

0:59:24.059,0:59:27.299
and i thought you know they are with the
new right

0:59:27.299,0:59:31.239
i need a bunch rasool with me

0:59:31.239,0:59:32.859
let's

0:59:32.859,0:59:36.189
like flip-flop

0:59:36.189,0:59:43.079
antonyms

0:59:43.079,0:59:43.999
reads a

0:59:43.999,0:59:45.409
to his

0:59:45.409,0:59:49.969
i'm composers dupont jonsman ripped the
consul off of the cutback

0:59:49.969,0:59:53.169
no

0:59:53.169,0:59:54.759
okay

0:59:54.759,0:59:56.329
it's got a boring

0:59:56.329,1:00:00.589
and there will be the review to you

1:00:00.589,1:00:02.959
this is going to be just like they did
before

1:00:02.959,1:00:08.099
rupal plug in the definition of two
picasa contradict absecon stand out

1:00:08.099,1:00:12.459
let them get all

1:00:12.459,1:00:16.949
regan leh pungent smell smelly mud drop
bombs in the normal and arrival

1:00:16.949,1:00:18.989
ladies like white wine

1:00:18.989,1:00:22.419
and get something that's kinda like a
land title of his reversal kinda like a

1:00:22.419,1:00:23.849
full

1:00:23.849,1:00:28.299
but it's just a pontoon to get one
valley

1:00:28.299,1:00:33.929
and if you didn't demand it be a
monolith it just worked

1:00:33.929,1:00:38.489
growing about website

1:00:38.489,1:00:40.449
so now

1:00:40.449,1:00:42.829
a lens

1:00:42.829,1:00:44.289
is just

1:00:44.289,1:00:46.219
eight reversal

1:00:46.219,1:00:48.549
that is a ballot yet

1:00:48.549,1:00:51.409
so if they traverse a loved one targeted
side of the structure and they have to

1:00:51.409,1:00:53.189
cut in half a diverse one target

1:00:53.189,1:00:55.080
given there's no way to build

1:00:55.080,1:00:55.880
this ab

1:00:55.880,1:00:59.129
to give it back to you honored that you
use your function

1:00:59.129,1:01:01.329
from a double date

1:01:01.329,1:01:04.539
right i have no not knowing audit up
other than the fact that the bump in the

1:01:04.539,1:01:08.129
end of the bunker that battle

1:01:08.129,1:01:09.779
and of the laws on

1:01:09.779,1:01:11.219
on terms such that

1:01:11.219,1:01:14.369
really doesn't matter however over it if
i have to happen in about the second

1:01:14.369,1:01:18.469
time i can always attach that the other

1:01:18.469,1:01:20.099
so

1:01:20.099,1:01:23.469
what what what that means is that i have
to go into my house

1:01:23.469,1:01:25.319
find a day

1:01:25.319,1:01:27.460
somewhere i think that we can talk or
not you know

1:01:27.460,1:01:28.819
a quicker

1:01:28.819,1:01:30.839
by an egg in a few by

1:01:30.839,1:01:33.879
pat calling upon check-in appleby out of
it

1:01:33.879,1:01:37.629
and then full the rest of the crap that
was inside a bass

1:01:37.629,1:01:41.409
under the answer inside of the model
inside of that the parker

1:01:41.409,1:01:45.019
there's nothing else i can do

1:01:45.019,1:01:46.419
joel ends

1:01:46.419,1:01:49.950
now under this formulation is just
andy's reversal

1:01:49.950,1:01:51.239
that happens to be

1:01:51.239,1:01:53.089
abella gather

1:01:53.089,1:01:57.160
because the debtor just said that the
sweat that cost army nothing about this

1:01:57.160,1:01:58.509
but we knew that

1:01:58.509,1:01:59.240
are

1:01:59.240,1:02:02.249
was a functor no matter what choice of
our wicca

1:02:02.249,1:02:06.389
its not applicable must we all my life

1:02:06.389,1:02:11.399
but we only have about a reality of it
with your work with

1:02:11.399,1:02:16.919
and i went really faster that's a there
will be hopefully video not cook up a

1:02:16.919,1:02:18.289
bit nervous

1:02:18.289,1:02:20.779
uh...

1:02:20.779,1:02:24.879
or we can do it is now as we had view
and sat

1:02:24.879,1:02:28.989
uh... setlist like bright too

1:02:28.989,1:02:33.199
and view let us re renew our way back to
the anymore and i think i would never do

1:02:33.199,1:02:35.529
anything and public threw it out

1:02:35.529,1:02:39.399
we can now derived the definitions from
that's like

1:02:39.399,1:02:43.019
in terms of this much crazier looking
construction

1:02:43.019,1:02:44.569
work

1:02:44.569,1:02:46.259
uh... here

1:02:46.259,1:02:53.259
deal with picking declined to be

1:02:53.869,1:02:55.660
constand

1:02:55.660,1:03:00.859
and satisfy king it to be agony

1:03:00.859,1:03:04.039
british choosing two different bunkers

1:03:04.039,1:03:04.959
probably

1:03:04.959,1:03:10.219
there were a lot of attorney bob we
walked on giving them the item in here

1:03:10.219,1:03:13.059
and so using that that power

1:03:13.059,1:03:17.069
we can read the single target out

1:03:17.069,1:03:18.399
or we can set up

1:03:18.399,1:03:21.589
but interestingly if i pass this guy up
all

1:03:21.589,1:03:22.390
now

1:03:22.390,1:03:27.329
spontaneously this is going to start
demanding that this argument be among

1:03:27.329,1:03:29.390
if you don't owe money for the net

1:03:29.390,1:03:32.419
you the answer a fault who doesn't have
any weight a smash together

1:03:32.419,1:03:35.209
all of the different response

1:03:35.209,1:03:39.099
so view works for polled say works for
lenses that works for commercial

1:03:39.099,1:03:43.099
leverage over sold about fall

1:03:43.099,1:03:46.849
so it will just be wild card to the
commercial

1:03:46.849,1:03:50.059
uh... and what we can sort of a
subtyping relationship between all of

1:03:50.059,1:03:53.549
these different right there with

1:03:53.549,1:03:54.779
where

1:03:54.779,1:03:58.969
using them in different contacts cause
these commentators demand according to

1:03:58.969,1:04:05.969
the

1:04:06.039,1:04:09.519
when we did buell earlier we reviewed
underscore one out of

1:04:09.519,1:04:12.489
hello

1:04:12.489,1:04:15.039
underscore one

1:04:15.039,1:04:17.199
was owens

1:04:17.199,1:04:19.109
a length of the vote getter

1:04:19.109,1:04:25.119
by getter can reads exactly one target
doesn't men amano tell us when we got a

1:04:25.119,1:04:28.209
but i wanted you both have said that she
would have to do something to that it's

1:04:28.209,1:04:34.959
got a state that should be getting
anyone trying to rescue strengths

1:04:34.959,1:04:37.789
just any as the model a first reading

1:04:37.789,1:04:42.849
there

1:04:42.849,1:04:46.629
uh...

1:04:46.629,1:04:52.779
and if we really want we can get them
out separately conflicts converts a list

1:04:52.779,1:04:58.079
well if there is yours is gonna complain
that does not do this

1:04:58.079,1:05:00.709
there was nothing to have a

1:05:00.709,1:05:03.929
we can say jimmy's and some of us

1:05:03.929,1:05:06.909
if that's going to pick up my life is
good inject them into the some model

1:05:06.909,1:05:08.239
item n

1:05:08.239,1:05:15.239
steelworker

1:05:22.179,1:05:23.750
there yes and and and do that

1:05:23.750,1:05:29.109
that is the instance of my my purse
strings

1:05:29.109,1:05:33.359
just yes it was a by default

1:05:33.359,1:05:37.249
you couldn't you could make up as a
moderate for any

1:05:37.249,1:05:40.719
yes because they did you really want to
adam you are more quiet

1:05:40.719,1:05:44.199
you know you it does not mean you could

1:05:44.199,1:05:47.799
so wet when there's no one right before
we just don't people

1:05:47.799,1:05:51.479
usually then you have to pick up
anything

1:05:51.479,1:05:54.039
well you can make it you can use any
type reveron like

1:05:54.039,1:05:55.750
that i could use um...

1:05:55.750,1:05:57.889
view both of

1:05:57.889,1:06:04.889
uh... district is not something that
missile effect

1:06:14.919,1:06:17.239
that's on the pillow talk

1:06:17.239,1:06:19.799
hypocritical

1:06:19.799,1:06:21.429
um...

1:06:21.429,1:06:22.739
kal okay

1:06:22.739,1:06:23.819
so now

1:06:23.819,1:06:26.359
we were able to build with view and sat

1:06:26.359,1:06:31.269
we can construct a lens given a

1:06:31.269,1:06:32.459
and a setter

1:06:32.459,1:06:36.650
but now we've got these funny b_n_p_
backgrounder winner wage but we think

1:06:36.650,1:06:38.829
about why that changed

1:06:38.829,1:06:42.499
right because we're we're allowed to
change the type are targets right

1:06:42.499,1:06:46.629
so before we talk about when the the
very beginning we just said that

1:06:46.629,1:06:49.469
well if i if i start with a alum

1:06:49.469,1:06:51.039
passing it made out

1:06:51.039,1:06:52.129
ever got up

1:06:52.129,1:06:55.739
an awsome and you and i can go back in
again you are

1:06:55.739,1:06:58.490
here what i'm saying is maybe wanting to
pay for that part

1:06:58.490,1:07:00.209
or all of the targets

1:07:00.209,1:07:02.399
involved wondered is were the ones

1:07:02.399,1:07:05.229
if you change the type of that target
will be

1:07:05.229,1:07:07.169
the new technology

1:07:07.169,1:07:10.209
again then turned out that you get this
family structure where

1:07:10.209,1:07:13.869
you've got like the out her family and
in her family and they they both have

1:07:13.869,1:07:15.469
indexes and i

1:07:15.469,1:07:16.399
written up

1:07:16.399,1:07:19.119
blog post on the topic is that if we
want to do indeed

1:07:19.119,1:07:20.129
uh... but

1:07:20.129,1:07:22.209
the

1:07:22.209,1:07:25.179
structure here usually sit is

1:07:25.179,1:07:28.409
a good way to tell if you've got a bell
atlantic you could all if you can always

1:07:28.409,1:07:29.579
pick

1:07:29.579,1:07:32.859
testicle steven eight will be

1:07:32.859,1:07:34.200
if you can't than you

1:07:34.200,1:07:35.799
probably screwed up and you don't have a
look

1:07:35.799,1:07:38.579
well the government you know

1:07:38.579,1:07:42.779
is a good witness trucks

1:07:42.779,1:07:44.659
if i gotta go from este

1:07:44.659,1:07:46.110
and a piano that's totally

1:07:46.110,1:07:49.369
and it came to a couple of pieces can i
have a nice

1:07:49.369,1:07:52.569
i date my aspirate last day

1:07:52.569,1:07:56.019
by midday if you'd like what you may not
be used

1:07:56.019,1:08:00.739
niigata annapolis bees like that that
will be looking at the movies

1:08:00.739,1:08:02.349
thank you compete

1:08:02.349,1:08:04.299
that was in my computer

1:08:04.299,1:08:06.669
and the absolute pleasure

1:08:06.669,1:08:09.869
and smash together guarantees nyah nyah
forties

1:08:09.869,1:08:11.089
and i need

1:08:11.089,1:08:18.089
that's an extra bed

1:08:18.829,1:08:22.130
their stockbridge

1:08:22.130,1:08:25.979
so again a lens update the single target
and you can define a lens in terms of a

1:08:25.979,1:08:27.480
debtor

1:08:27.480,1:08:31.290
in practice i'd never bothered to do it
this way

1:08:31.290,1:08:33.599
because its

1:08:33.599,1:08:35.609
is here for me and practice just a

1:08:35.609,1:08:38.650
closer to about and a pair of a and b

1:08:38.650,1:08:39.650
should look like

1:08:39.650,1:08:41.799
where the now

1:08:41.799,1:08:46.639
reminders wicker shelf life

1:08:46.639,1:08:50.719
that's alliance

1:08:50.719,1:08:57.719
as soon as i have everything

1:08:59.359,1:09:00.729
uh... um

1:09:00.729,1:09:02.030
also know something here

1:09:02.030,1:09:05.549
i didn't have to import my library to
write back

1:09:05.549,1:09:07.219
there

1:09:07.219,1:09:10.549
brett so you can write lenses that are
compatible with the lens library

1:09:10.549,1:09:13.370
unifying commercials that are compatible
with the lens library

1:09:13.370,1:09:14.279
without dip

1:09:14.279,1:09:18.609
pending fumble and wiper

1:09:18.609,1:09:22.410
ratkai just used this guy could be a
staff map of the prelude i wouldn't have

1:09:22.410,1:09:24.920
been

1:09:24.920,1:09:27.970
orgasm using just the prelude you can
define the land

1:09:27.970,1:09:32.479
it is perfectly compatible with pollock
commons i give you a cooler

1:09:32.479,1:09:34.779
and one of the reasons that this is
important is

1:09:34.779,1:09:36.519
is that did you view

1:09:36.519,1:09:40.299
kab all kind of like an onion their
entire something where he like

1:09:40.299,1:09:44.459
packages come along and they may just
get calendar layers on the onion

1:09:44.459,1:09:46.520
uh... later packages

1:09:46.520,1:09:49.279
how do you have to provide all of the

1:09:49.279,1:09:50.109
stuff

1:09:50.109,1:09:51.319
per pack a dessert

1:09:51.319,1:09:55.330
deeper than them in in in uh... in the
west is really hard inverted dependency

1:09:55.330,1:09:56.989
in the fall world

1:09:56.989,1:09:58.289
uh...

1:09:58.289,1:10:00.719
and you can have cycles

1:10:00.719,1:10:04.969
so if i were to come along later in the
final library

1:10:04.969,1:10:08.780
i do have some great instances for
containers i'd better put them on my

1:10:08.780,1:10:13.639
library because there's no way i'm
getting containers depend on me

1:10:13.639,1:10:15.840
on the other hand with business

1:10:15.840,1:10:20.460
i could say i did try and convince your
honor degree somebody and other gotta go

1:10:20.460,1:10:22.260
alligator steam

1:10:22.260,1:10:24.030
to make a

1:10:24.030,1:10:31.030
islands to go to burst the offer
argument on the part of the

1:10:31.059,1:10:32.219
and

1:10:32.219,1:10:35.139
that might be an argument i could win

1:10:35.139,1:10:37.939
uh... and so this is this

1:10:37.939,1:10:40.859
uh... somebody made a joke that i've got
to the point where bob might well

1:10:40.859,1:10:43.079
aberrational point we don't have to
depend on them

1:10:43.079,1:10:48.090
anymore popularity of any of them uh...
not

1:10:48.090,1:10:48.780
um

1:10:48.780,1:10:52.469
i think is a really big selling point
for this kind of lands

1:10:52.469,1:10:54.030
if nothing else

1:10:54.030,1:10:57.860
uh... because it solves that twelve
which might lead to invite radio i

1:10:57.860,1:10:59.530
provide lens for

1:10:59.530,1:11:06.530
uh... you don't have to become a
dependency in his right about here

1:11:08.750,1:11:10.429
yeah

1:11:10.429,1:11:12.719
itself

1:11:12.719,1:11:14.849
so this this is by the critical

1:11:14.849,1:11:17.369
uh... and then the other thing is is
this just magically become the

1:11:17.369,1:11:20.489
commercial if i started to say

1:11:20.489,1:11:21.760
well and

1:11:21.760,1:11:28.760
walk this one too

1:11:30.639,1:11:34.449
objects o traverse als and pump and
lenders can both be provided by any

1:11:34.449,1:11:35.260
library

1:11:35.260,1:11:39.699
without leaving depending on

1:11:39.699,1:11:46.699
link line doesn't have a some are all
yet

1:11:46.809,1:11:47.570
if you can

1:11:47.570,1:11:49.389
breaker prep

1:11:49.389,1:11:51.909
yep so given

1:11:51.909,1:11:52.909
upare

1:11:52.909,1:11:53.860
apiece

1:11:53.860,1:11:56.050
and a bunch of repute up badly than ever

1:11:56.050,1:12:00.580
apparent

1:12:00.580,1:12:01.579
but now

1:12:01.579,1:12:04.940
because i have to be able to smash
together the answers

1:12:04.940,1:12:07.590
immediately

1:12:07.590,1:12:10.110
and that's the thing that will magically
make independent amato right when you go

1:12:10.110,1:12:12.320
to use

1:12:12.320,1:12:15.329
one of the old comic

1:12:15.329,1:12:17.550
so you can use this traverse or as a
whole

1:12:17.550,1:12:19.650
as it were sold

1:12:19.650,1:12:21.030
it just works

1:12:21.030,1:12:23.070
you use this lands

1:12:23.070,1:12:24.489
reminders were too

1:12:24.489,1:12:30.359
as a old garrett reversal all things are
good may just happen to be instantiation

1:12:30.359,1:12:37.359
to the fact that we can

1:12:38.919,1:12:41.150
so we can now make

1:12:41.150,1:12:43.930
missing the definition of that

1:12:43.930,1:12:46.570
uh...

1:12:46.570,1:12:48.590
so we want to go defying

1:12:48.590,1:12:50.229
elan's into a map

1:12:50.229,1:12:54.539
like innately might say won't give it a
key into them

1:12:54.539,1:12:57.570
i want to go get you the value at that

1:12:57.570,1:12:59.109
it like

1:12:59.109,1:13:02.669
that doesn't white

1:13:02.669,1:13:05.550
what about you mention what value liking
you

1:13:05.550,1:13:07.539
at the end with your father

1:13:07.539,1:13:09.550
so i can't do this

1:13:09.550,1:13:11.369
i try to write the paper

1:13:11.369,1:13:14.219
delicate reversal birth you know

1:13:14.219,1:13:19.340
and that you updated if it's already
present

1:13:19.340,1:13:23.060
but that's not letting you know

1:13:23.060,1:13:27.159
create akeel or

1:13:27.159,1:13:34.159
but what i can do

1:13:36.469,1:13:42.489
so we can say mapped out from us this
terrible amount

1:13:42.489,1:13:44.080
so this is at the site

1:13:44.080,1:13:47.199
uh... matthew to insert delete and do it

1:13:47.199,1:13:48.330
it builds up

1:13:48.330,1:13:52.040
annoys size balanced binary tree

1:13:52.040,1:13:59.039
performed really well

1:13:59.039,1:14:00.699
so we can read it up a lot

1:14:00.699,1:14:07.699
this is an ethical review

1:14:08.929,1:14:10.800
we do reiki is not present

1:14:10.800,1:14:17.800
in dozens of april levees that's getting
out and maybe

1:14:20.499,1:14:24.219
close to a permit

1:14:24.219,1:14:26.070
so i can read and write to it

1:14:26.070,1:14:29.929
but i can i can only read in right now
is akin to leap from the map using

1:14:29.929,1:14:32.849
eleven

1:14:32.849,1:14:36.500
and that's how i can meet the landforms

1:14:36.500,1:14:39.040
is that not only do i read

1:14:39.040,1:14:39.850
and right

1:14:39.850,1:14:42.070
i can delete because i can go from

1:14:42.070,1:14:43.330
given a key

1:14:43.330,1:14:47.500
i give you a lens that looks at the
value that he had to present

1:14:47.500,1:14:49.489
or gives you nothing of its not

1:14:49.489,1:14:52.860
and it will insert it when you put up a
bit suggest

1:14:52.860,1:14:58.030
and will be a lead if you put up with
them

1:14:58.030,1:15:03.889
now act is actually generalize that
worked with it option somewhat but

1:15:03.889,1:15:07.420
in fact conceptually you can think of
that as having the signature with a

1:15:07.420,1:15:14.420
maybe a again

1:15:17.469,1:15:18.740
although i pull the wool

1:15:18.740,1:15:21.189
we talked about

1:15:21.189,1:15:22.360
um...

1:15:22.360,1:15:24.940
there's a whole bunch of numbers you
carry dupre

1:15:24.940,1:15:28.059
opal hit up a little right

1:15:28.059,1:15:29.730
but a lot of them

1:15:29.730,1:15:30.889
uh... we did we get them all

1:15:30.889,1:15:33.659
uh... but this of

1:15:33.659,1:15:35.100
convention

1:15:35.100,1:15:36.059
um...

1:15:36.059,1:15:38.689
burning lens provide something like six
or seven hundred different names with

1:15:38.689,1:15:39.269
things

1:15:39.269,1:15:42.909
that um... i actually did a good word
search like frequency analysis against

1:15:42.909,1:15:44.149
package before

1:15:44.149,1:15:48.199
releasing the library the try minimize
their complex so that's why we do the of

1:15:48.199,1:15:49.760
convention in suffolk va

1:15:49.760,1:15:53.559
um we have lots of past tenses i take
names and places that nobody does feel

1:15:53.559,1:15:55.730
like we use joined in person

1:15:55.730,1:15:56.469
huh

1:15:56.469,1:15:59.920
sojourn so we we who eating

1:15:59.920,1:16:01.400
and sort of you know

1:16:01.400,1:16:04.380
so that's what's holding them pull their
guns without

1:16:04.380,1:16:08.409
past tenses so things things that get us
names that are declarative

1:16:08.409,1:16:11.399
but our relatively underutilized
portions of the namespace of the people

1:16:11.399,1:16:15.139
can import lands unqualified because
control dot length brief and all the

1:16:15.139,1:16:16.909
stuff

1:16:16.909,1:16:17.950
uh...

1:16:17.950,1:16:19.559
at that point

1:16:19.559,1:16:23.320
and i really didn't want people happy
import something qualified or explicitly

1:16:23.320,1:16:25.300
near everything they do so

1:16:25.300,1:16:28.050
because it's really hard to give a talk
if you have to name

1:16:28.050,1:16:31.520
every door detroit using your card
before you can use it

1:16:31.520,1:16:32.769
here

1:16:32.769,1:16:37.169
uh... it it's it's much nicer to having
large vocabulary that you could just

1:16:37.169,1:16:39.070
reach for

1:16:39.070,1:16:40.920
and and in many ways

1:16:40.920,1:16:45.230
the lead bribery of all about building
that vocabulary for working with bunkers

1:16:45.230,1:16:46.500
and pull the wool

1:16:46.500,1:16:50.519
and reversible and function that we
already know how to use right

1:16:50.519,1:16:54.300
uh... so all we did all i did was to
take the pieces that we already know

1:16:54.300,1:16:56.460
although we are not a reason about

1:16:56.460,1:16:58.210
those those poor things

1:16:58.210,1:17:01.150
and put them together in a form that
makes them more comfortable

1:17:01.150,1:17:03.590
and makes them more applicable to that i
can to say

1:17:03.590,1:17:07.399
just grab this coming around chocolate
to give them has limited portion of them

1:17:07.399,1:17:12.920
and i can apply for the entire gamut of
over possible

1:17:12.920,1:17:14.500
uh... and so

1:17:14.500,1:17:18.019
the problem is a really convenient if
you have a poll

1:17:18.019,1:17:22.599
or a traverse all metlife is probably
furor when a woman few you have like

1:17:22.599,1:17:23.510
maybe

1:17:23.510,1:17:25.400
they didn't give me an answer may be a
while

1:17:25.400,1:17:27.130
um... this

1:17:27.130,1:17:30.519
this guy will go do you know the per
capita gin

1:17:30.519,1:17:32.699
the request matured a lot

1:17:32.699,1:17:34.929
uh... care about dot

1:17:34.929,1:17:37.570
get you a list of all the answers

1:17:37.570,1:17:43.229
on so i can do you think your not which
is uh... arm

1:17:43.229,1:17:44.199
its view

1:17:44.199,1:17:50.559
weapon into court

1:17:50.559,1:17:52.949
so the

1:17:52.949,1:17:55.690
killed on the others for like setting
operations like

1:17:55.690,1:17:57.540
it's functional centers

1:17:57.540,1:18:00.210
that supply this operator

1:18:00.210,1:18:03.099
and carrot dot as you carrot something
usually

1:18:03.099,1:18:04.710
i'm reading from a

1:18:04.710,1:18:06.449
compared

1:18:06.449,1:18:09.330
so here i am reading from a pull

1:18:09.330,1:18:11.300
and giving you maybe

1:18:11.300,1:18:14.090
here i'm reading from a hold of giving
you all the others the dot that should

1:18:14.090,1:18:18.879
be indicative of that but that that's
the best that you know yeah

1:18:18.879,1:18:24.239
so we got your essay given one too

1:18:24.239,1:18:30.459
and i'd lost my ability that the gospel

1:18:30.459,1:18:34.309
meat-packing

1:18:34.309,1:18:36.510
browning

1:18:36.510,1:18:39.969
uh...

1:18:39.969,1:18:42.090
one too

1:18:42.090,1:18:44.289
lee for

1:18:44.289,1:18:51.289
traversing the me though

1:18:59.179,1:19:06.179
or both double right

1:19:07.330,1:19:13.580
and then let's say that we had

1:19:13.580,1:19:15.280
three

1:19:15.280,1:19:22.280
tell me whether or not

1:19:27.840,1:19:31.190
and so most of the things you can do it
then the whole blvd recollection all the

1:19:31.190,1:19:35.820
things you can do to a beloved and in
doing a lot of things a build-up

1:19:35.820,1:19:38.210
the structure actually got the most
loving that you can use to build a

1:19:38.210,1:19:44.249
political action if the user deriva four

1:19:44.249,1:19:46.730
parents who writes departments like this

1:19:46.730,1:19:49.550
again urgent order

1:19:49.550,1:19:51.570
uh...

1:19:51.570,1:19:55.030
together just like functions

1:19:55.030,1:19:59.849
this is what you are supposed to drink

1:19:59.849,1:20:02.310
uh...

1:20:02.310,1:20:05.290
actually implement these are a little
bit of away like up until now i've been

1:20:05.290,1:20:06.599
saying that i got that

1:20:06.599,1:20:09.269
you just pick identity or you pick

1:20:09.269,1:20:13.719
uh...

1:20:13.719,1:20:15.249
const

1:20:15.249,1:20:18.049
uh... actually used

1:20:18.049,1:20:19.340
classwork

1:20:19.340,1:20:22.370
because if i don't get by user id by
actually just pet

1:20:22.370,1:20:23.760
conficker identity

1:20:23.760,1:20:27.269
and i know that i want to go green from
center

1:20:27.269,1:20:28.860
or write you a debtor

1:20:28.860,1:20:32.150
i would get a terrible looking
unification earth it would be like

1:20:32.150,1:20:33.689
srinu

1:20:33.689,1:20:38.139
okay but instead i quickens our class
constraint on it it will unify and then

1:20:38.139,1:20:40.320
it will look for instance that isn't
there

1:20:40.320,1:20:44.919
and i want to say no instance perak
others saleable music uh... access or no

1:20:44.919,1:20:46.829
inference of double nuclear

1:20:46.829,1:20:52.540
and now looks much nicer in some adopted
him getting into it what they did wrong

1:20:52.540,1:20:55.010
uh... so i actually can't match

1:20:55.010,1:20:59.879
that const construction by making a
class were things that are double

1:20:59.879,1:21:02.349
maganda setting for separate appleby

1:21:02.349,1:21:04.420
and why is that not about

1:21:04.420,1:21:08.480
wrapping up half people's court

1:21:08.480,1:21:12.019
so this this can't happen any minute

1:21:12.019,1:21:13.489
because

1:21:13.489,1:21:16.530
you know in order to satisfy that law

1:21:16.530,1:21:20.340
use the functions uh... map of it

1:21:20.340,1:21:22.420
uh... and so once i get done with that

1:21:22.420,1:21:26.409
now debtors not quite

1:21:26.409,1:21:28.530
uh... way that we go

1:21:28.530,1:21:33.039
reversible

1:21:33.039,1:21:34.480
art reversible and left

1:21:34.480,1:21:35.920
record reversal in lands

1:21:35.920,1:21:40.400
used functor looking at here using
double

1:21:40.400,1:21:44.719
and then

1:21:44.719,1:21:47.640
so it's an obsessive opinion of going
out to put it

1:21:47.640,1:21:50.949
polling often bring back on a new
contract or understand course

1:21:50.949,1:21:56.829
turnover may internet would be visit
yeah i know that that big a role

1:21:56.829,1:21:57.990
and getting

1:21:57.990,1:22:03.030
can still pick it to be accessories as a
friend inundated constantly

1:22:03.030,1:22:10.030
the standard

1:22:17.169,1:22:17.920
lenders

1:22:17.920,1:22:21.670
agis anything above the gutter of
commercial

1:22:21.670,1:22:24.530
uh... we had a whole piled commenters
really is um...

1:22:24.530,1:22:26.219
so today shouldn't you

1:22:26.219,1:22:28.349
um...

1:22:28.349,1:22:29.389
updating

1:22:29.389,1:22:30.189
the target

1:22:30.189,1:22:32.919
i can read the answer that i wrote

1:22:32.919,1:22:34.570
at the same because

1:22:34.570,1:22:38.179
uh... if they are beginning to go are
updated by

1:22:38.179,1:22:41.849
cutbacks variable count and that
happened over here

1:22:41.849,1:22:44.219
uh...

1:22:44.219,1:22:47.329
so i quit yes you can go through and to
find something like

1:22:47.329,1:22:49.650
i know left freshen equals

1:22:49.650,1:22:56.449
uh...

1:22:56.449,1:22:59.179
uh...

1:22:59.179,1:23:01.169
normal marxism

1:23:01.169,1:23:05.270
structured the

1:23:05.270,1:23:06.929
back cat

1:23:06.929,1:23:09.820
social say in any money at stake

1:23:09.820,1:23:11.959
that have caused the cut

1:23:11.959,1:23:14.679
uh... that has an america it

1:23:14.679,1:23:15.920
by ken

1:23:15.920,1:23:17.619
bump the car by one

1:23:17.619,1:23:19.149
and read the new value

1:23:19.149,1:23:22.079
online

1:23:22.079,1:23:23.959
are you would be identity lanphear

1:23:23.959,1:23:29.579
pledged by the way is just the identity
function

1:23:29.579,1:23:33.229
seven composing these things all im but
i haven't really talked about why they

1:23:33.229,1:23:37.280
compose right lol

1:23:37.280,1:23:40.020
if we look at this this is a function

1:23:40.020,1:23:40.999
from

1:23:40.999,1:23:42.949
in appleby too

1:23:42.949,1:23:45.330
estaba meat

1:23:45.330,1:23:51.159
and when i compose them i'm compiling
those functions the outer rappers

1:23:51.159,1:23:53.330
timeline from ada theater

1:23:53.330,1:23:55.800
as a victim here that goes well

1:23:55.800,1:24:00.449
uh... xd af of why eight af of b so i
compose those night open ac staff of y

1:24:00.449,1:24:04.690
de step

1:24:04.690,1:24:08.389
composing these larger box that's why i
can use dot mcgrew

1:24:08.389,1:24:10.769
you can actually build these things
using a rupture there if you really want

1:24:10.769,1:24:12.330
to

1:24:12.330,1:24:16.819
you know that arabs

1:24:16.819,1:24:18.280
just passport

1:24:18.280,1:24:20.320
uh...

1:24:20.320,1:24:22.940
everything composers backwards because
we're

1:24:22.940,1:24:29.369
if you look at this is a kind of sepia

1:24:29.369,1:24:31.460
so

1:24:31.460,1:24:35.730
we've got lots of things we know lenses

1:24:35.730,1:24:37.290
built you know i gather

1:24:37.290,1:24:40.389
built up just a c_b_s_ function

1:24:40.389,1:24:44.179
put into effect on that uh...

1:24:44.179,1:24:46.489
now let's do something fun

1:24:46.489,1:24:48.260
um... yeah

1:24:48.260,1:24:50.119
so up until now

1:24:50.119,1:24:56.309
we men just kind of manipulating happier

1:24:56.309,1:24:58.760
uh... there is a hack that i came up
with

1:24:58.760,1:25:01.239
fallible four years ago that are used to
know

1:25:01.239,1:25:04.610
a little play

1:25:04.610,1:25:07.860
overloading function application
everybody says you can't do this let

1:25:07.860,1:25:10.780
them and not everybody but a lot of
people so you can do this

1:25:10.780,1:25:13.739
uh... but again

1:25:13.739,1:25:15.239
right you know what to make

1:25:15.239,1:25:20.099
uh... datatype where you define how it
applies to values

1:25:20.099,1:25:23.599
but what we can do as we can make a
class such that are datatype is an

1:25:23.599,1:25:25.030
instance of the class

1:25:25.030,1:25:25.890
and

1:25:25.890,1:25:29.080
a function isn't it for the class and
then we can get overloaded function

1:25:29.080,1:25:31.329
application

1:25:31.329,1:25:32.809
and what i want to score

1:25:32.809,1:25:37.570
is i just want to be able to find a
function which i can run backwards

1:25:37.570,1:25:41.169
okay and i'm gonna turn it into a lot

1:25:41.169,1:25:41.900
berlet's

1:25:41.900,1:25:43.559
residents like

1:25:43.559,1:25:44.659
in small steps

1:25:44.659,1:25:47.920
and this is the slides hit the slight
here is a bit of a lot to learn how we

1:25:47.920,1:25:50.860
have to do it will end early mornings
this is the way we did up until three

1:25:50.860,1:25:52.170
points

1:25:52.170,1:25:54.459
electric one seven stretched

1:25:54.459,1:26:01.459
but um... i think this is about her
vision than that

1:26:02.010,1:26:03.700
but but the district would work

1:26:03.700,1:26:06.040
in the wild desperately

1:26:06.040,1:26:07.689
so what's are you wanted to make

1:26:07.689,1:26:09.429
isomorphism

1:26:09.429,1:26:12.359
specialize market with a bunch of that
you can apply like any other function an

1:26:12.359,1:26:14.429
asshole

1:26:14.429,1:26:16.110
but you could also use from

1:26:16.110,1:26:18.469
but right around

1:26:18.469,1:26:21.690
united workers on the other direction so
you can you could've life but then from

1:26:21.690,1:26:26.139
that from would be it

1:26:26.139,1:26:27.939
so i did was arrested

1:26:27.939,1:26:31.089
i'm a disc last night for want of a
better day might i called if by some

1:26:31.089,1:26:32.330
arctic

1:26:32.330,1:26:35.810
it's something that i can construct a
black market

1:26:35.810,1:26:37.500
survive if i have

1:26:37.500,1:26:38.850
a function from eight a b_

1:26:38.850,1:26:42.820
and a function from being a pain felt
that there could be emerges uh... uh...

1:26:42.820,1:26:45.340
they're usually work with

1:26:45.340,1:26:49.039
i can give your pay

1:26:49.039,1:26:51.179
personal

1:26:51.179,1:26:53.209
and i can make

1:26:53.209,1:26:54.580
functions themselves

1:26:54.580,1:26:56.090
the essence of isomorphic

1:26:56.090,1:26:58.979
just by lorraine this thing

1:26:58.979,1:27:00.369
i can construct a function

1:27:00.369,1:27:03.900
repeatedly in the park may be able to

1:27:03.900,1:27:05.760
that ripple

1:27:05.760,1:27:07.230
and i can make a good night

1:27:07.230,1:27:08.459
isomorphism

1:27:08.459,1:27:11.070
which actually captured both

1:27:11.070,1:27:14.550
and this would also be a perfectly valid
instance of isomorphic when they got

1:27:14.550,1:27:19.560
marbled with instructor look after the
eighty will capture the beauty of it

1:27:19.560,1:27:21.610
values both sides of the first time

1:27:21.610,1:27:23.619
delivery

1:27:23.619,1:27:26.000
bringing a category-four isomorphism

1:27:26.000,1:27:27.840
so we can compose isomorphism

1:27:27.840,1:27:30.159
so you have two important role i
category

1:27:30.159,1:27:32.280
to get its version of dot ended

1:27:32.280,1:27:33.789
inordinately composi

1:27:33.789,1:27:34.719
if you didn't

1:27:34.719,1:27:37.119
there's going to come down to functions

1:27:37.119,1:27:38.679
when you put them

1:27:38.679,1:27:42.179
actually perfectly good

1:27:42.179,1:27:43.100
so now

1:27:43.100,1:27:44.399
we'd say

1:27:44.399,1:27:47.820
you know it is nice work even if you
have any questions if you have

1:27:47.820,1:27:50.920
the the the the

1:27:50.920,1:27:54.050
nationally on the way along with that

1:27:54.050,1:27:57.400
uh... we didn't have much more press
more for them

1:27:57.400,1:28:01.780
millions though that they don't give up
a doing time being

1:28:01.780,1:28:04.280
is anything alleged market

1:28:04.280,1:28:05.489
that day

1:28:05.489,1:28:07.559
from katie from katie

1:28:07.559,1:28:11.260
so this can be checked this can choose
this day to be a poncho if you had any

1:28:11.260,1:28:13.309
contact would have to be a fun trip

1:28:13.309,1:28:16.750
higgins used in the eyes of our ability
to you that i think like from

1:28:16.750,1:28:18.829
or it has to be a nice marcus

1:28:18.829,1:28:23.210
so if i need access to both sides of the
pontiff i can turn this time around

1:28:23.210,1:28:27.659
and give you a new

1:28:27.659,1:28:29.820
so now would best i could say

1:28:29.820,1:28:31.290
you know um...

1:28:31.290,1:28:32.650
isomorphic

1:28:32.650,1:28:36.239
plus one and subtract one

1:28:36.239,1:28:38.189
didn't mean that function apt

1:28:38.189,1:28:40.770
and i can apply after five intuitively

1:28:40.770,1:28:43.369
six like it's a from half

1:28:43.369,1:28:46.619
six would be fine

1:28:46.619,1:28:50.800
uh... and with the composition works

1:28:50.800,1:28:52.289
so this gives us

1:28:52.289,1:28:54.550
overload isomorphism so work is
functions

1:28:54.550,1:28:57.469
but i want them as lenses write one of
the ways that we don't like that a lot

1:28:57.469,1:28:58.669
of other one library

1:28:58.669,1:29:02.210
louis what happened to me by so we just
give the isomorphism lightweight

1:29:02.210,1:29:05.409
kinda forget the fact that we
constructed out a whole clocked the

1:29:05.409,1:29:07.179
other way

1:29:07.179,1:29:11.010
you just get will use this is the center

1:29:11.010,1:29:12.729
and we just ignoring me

1:29:12.729,1:29:15.519
david were packed

1:29:15.519,1:29:20.409
but i want to have that that that full
power ternal ends around depict is it

1:29:20.409,1:29:27.409
means to an isomorphism i wonder when it
backward

1:29:27.590,1:29:28.830
so it like i did

1:29:28.830,1:29:32.929
inc here with the plus one of the crack
with them

1:29:32.929,1:29:34.709
so

1:29:34.709,1:29:35.709
let's make

1:29:35.709,1:29:37.150
i think so

1:29:37.150,1:29:39.199
kinda like london commercial

1:29:39.199,1:29:42.150
boring to do there's a run-up etc

1:29:42.150,1:29:46.269
came here the outer function that the
budget we're between a double b_ enough

1:29:46.269,1:29:47.179
seventy

1:29:47.179,1:29:48.860
nikkei

1:29:48.860,1:29:51.959
work his finances of isomorphic

1:29:51.959,1:29:54.869
and so now i can give you a punch enough
of me

1:29:54.869,1:29:56.290
that at seven p

1:29:56.290,1:29:57.829
or i can give you

1:29:57.829,1:30:01.199
past apathy made up a bit

1:30:01.199,1:30:05.649
i can pivot around that central error

1:30:05.649,1:30:08.879
okay this is the old way

1:30:08.879,1:30:11.320
the signature

1:30:11.320,1:30:14.199
but there's at least get you intuition

1:30:14.199,1:30:18.090
uh... and so this used to require us to
provide us all four function the new

1:30:18.090,1:30:21.110
version actually let slice of the both
of these

1:30:21.110,1:30:21.999
in order

1:30:21.999,1:30:24.719
wife

1:30:24.719,1:30:27.800
um...

1:30:27.800,1:30:28.870
but

1:30:28.870,1:30:32.130
all we're going to do is say you give me
that you two sets of mutually inverse

1:30:32.130,1:30:33.560
functions and i can give you

1:30:33.560,1:30:38.280
isomorphism family that works helical
and family

1:30:38.280,1:30:40.780
and then we go through and say

1:30:40.780,1:30:46.439
we make an isomorphism between spring
apcst

1:30:46.439,1:30:47.760
so that

1:30:47.760,1:30:48.719
taxed

1:30:48.719,1:30:50.889
or the senate

1:30:50.889,1:30:52.600
will this will take

1:30:52.600,1:30:56.630
street attacks by packing uh... opted
out of it uh...

1:30:56.630,1:30:57.309
will take

1:30:57.309,1:31:00.320
texas land mine back again

1:31:00.320,1:31:01.820
call it an isomorphism

1:31:01.820,1:31:04.570
ignoring illegal characters but without
that

1:31:04.570,1:31:07.499
because before pope

1:31:07.499,1:31:11.440
and then we can define our text reversal
earlier on

1:31:11.440,1:31:12.909
just from packed

1:31:12.909,1:31:13.810
the payments

1:31:13.810,1:31:15.760
by some of them

1:31:15.760,1:31:18.939
write backwards

1:31:18.939,1:31:20.590
an introvert combat

1:31:20.590,1:31:22.429
now i can post a nice o

1:31:22.429,1:31:23.679
with a drummer soul

1:31:23.679,1:31:28.090
and i got back to russel

1:31:28.090,1:31:29.839
because what happened was

1:31:29.839,1:31:31.989
when i do want to do this composition

1:31:31.989,1:31:32.949
this

1:31:32.949,1:31:35.819
forced me outside to be an actual punch
in a row

1:31:35.819,1:31:41.760
so there's activity on general which is
a balance is awesome arctic

1:31:41.760,1:31:43.409
uh... your return

1:31:43.409,1:31:47.169
packed around three years that at
isomorphism

1:31:47.169,1:31:48.190
but katie

1:31:48.190,1:31:50.999
dat chose pay to be a culture

1:31:50.999,1:31:53.360
and which option

1:31:53.360,1:32:00.360
and so this is where the cello world a
couple actually disposed

1:32:02.110,1:32:03.900
in practice we use

1:32:03.900,1:32:05.780
of what we're going to the pressure of

1:32:05.780,1:32:10.209
that lets us de l'alma minimalist

1:32:10.209,1:32:12.459
and there's actually

1:32:12.459,1:32:14.989
face similar construction for these
things we called prism set up a

1:32:14.989,1:32:17.249
mechanism to go to prison for that

1:32:17.249,1:32:21.460
presenter what happens if you'd like to
take a categorical warble lands

1:32:21.460,1:32:23.829
so they might have what you access one
field

1:32:23.829,1:32:26.159
about product like thing

1:32:26.159,1:32:28.199
or part of a product

1:32:28.199,1:32:29.770
and a

1:32:29.770,1:32:34.039
uh... prism but you access one
constructor out of a song

1:32:34.039,1:32:37.069
and so like left and right are excellent
president but not commercial both the

1:32:37.069,1:32:40.760
left mike kinsley

1:32:40.760,1:32:42.690
uh...

1:32:42.690,1:32:44.400
that's the bulk of the top

1:32:44.400,1:32:45.820
about is what i'd like

1:32:45.820,1:32:49.669
show like a deep dive in a couple of
quick things

1:32:49.669,1:32:51.760
think i'm done

1:32:51.760,1:32:53.539
i'm a democrat

1:32:53.539,1:32:56.469
okay that's about her

1:32:56.469,1:32:58.309
so

1:32:58.309,1:33:02.760
there's a how many of the view of using
a player ever to be in a place

1:33:02.760,1:33:05.689
seeing a play a library for doing it our
programming at school with written by

1:33:05.689,1:33:06.709
dale mitchell

1:33:06.709,1:33:11.360
armpits it should really nice it
performs really well it's fast

1:33:11.360,1:33:12.689
uh...

1:33:12.689,1:33:16.909
i embedded a copy of your plate inside
of less which seems kind of redundant

1:33:16.909,1:33:20.619
but what i did was iri defined the
interplay commentator so that they are

1:33:20.619,1:33:21.770
ballot reversals

1:33:21.770,1:33:25.909
are rather so the commentators can take
any traversal

1:33:25.909,1:33:31.010
and so that and that you know
play-by-play are actually commercials

1:33:31.010,1:33:33.600
i was actually saw the number probably
in a playpen then

1:33:33.600,1:33:35.979
as a side of the coming up

1:33:35.979,1:33:37.749
uh... dude

1:33:37.749,1:33:38.699
tender

1:33:38.699,1:33:41.519
so we can as you can define a class with
us at the say

1:33:41.519,1:33:44.800
played it as a class that knows how that
is a traverse alot of thinking about a

1:33:44.800,1:33:46.489
minute

1:33:46.489,1:33:49.709
it's like go find all of the sub trees
of my children that you have a syntax

1:33:49.709,1:33:53.499
tree go find me all the childhood one
level down you gave me a descendant

1:33:53.499,1:33:58.439
targets of extreme of the same time
provided some expression shin

1:33:58.439,1:34:00.530
them say by the balkans in order

1:34:00.530,1:34:03.199
it uses one of these guys that you
cannot do that

1:34:03.199,1:34:07.790
that builder complicate leaving all why
the complex tall also nearby brings a

1:34:07.790,1:34:08.919
bottle

1:34:08.919,1:34:11.889
uh...

1:34:11.889,1:34:15.080
in heels library he go thirty buildup by
data structure

1:34:15.080,1:34:18.329
uh... kinda mimic the shape of the
intermediate structure

1:34:18.329,1:34:21.469
and i don't have to adjust captured in
the environment and sizes are not

1:34:21.469,1:34:24.329
building up and hearing something down i
save all that time and that's world

1:34:24.329,1:34:26.719
speed

1:34:26.719,1:34:28.389
uh...

1:34:28.389,1:34:30.840
but you can make explicit in slow plated

1:34:30.840,1:34:34.479
and then unlike like his coming would
like rewrite which would take

1:34:34.479,1:34:36.039
parkinson's and in a play

1:34:36.039,1:34:38.399
because this his classname

1:34:38.399,1:34:39.569
um...

1:34:39.569,1:34:41.119
we just have rewrite uh...

1:34:41.119,1:34:42.530
which grammar right on

1:34:42.530,1:34:43.790
this case the center

1:34:43.790,1:34:45.780
most and take a traverse all

1:34:45.780,1:34:48.749
uh... ignore those scary looking
signatures that we really can't there's

1:34:48.749,1:34:51.079
no model

1:34:51.079,1:34:53.560
uh...

1:34:53.560,1:34:55.750
but

1:34:55.750,1:34:57.949
the

1:34:57.949,1:35:02.129
these governors are actually really nice
in that

1:35:02.129,1:35:03.219
organism

1:35:03.219,1:35:05.639
critical years things like uh...

1:35:05.639,1:35:08.969
using these purging our programming
being used by quick to say

1:35:08.969,1:35:10.899
don't look in

1:35:10.899,1:35:14.070
this word go look for hello world

1:35:14.070,1:35:16.869
uh...

1:35:16.869,1:35:18.320
there

1:35:18.320,1:35:20.300
strings

1:35:20.300,1:35:25.040
in here

1:35:25.040,1:35:26.599
and go for it all

1:35:26.599,1:35:28.639
uh... post-riot

1:35:28.639,1:35:32.929
that uh... data lengths

1:35:32.929,1:35:34.450
his prolific list of the

1:35:34.450,1:35:37.860
and define all the strengths rather than
all the events

1:35:37.860,1:35:39.809
and so that went into

1:35:39.809,1:35:41.300
returnable didn't like that

1:35:41.300,1:35:44.690
use mac we're going to find all the
string anywhere inside a researcher as

1:35:44.690,1:35:47.329
long as it is searcher keep it that was
it is the data

1:35:47.329,1:35:50.579
and the thing that i was looking forward

1:35:50.579,1:35:53.849
uh... but i can also update from

1:35:53.849,1:35:57.550
yeah because as a traverse ult

1:35:57.550,1:36:00.290
yet

1:36:00.290,1:36:01.710
so take that thing

1:36:01.710,1:36:03.530
and sets

1:36:03.530,1:36:04.629
fell by play

1:36:04.629,1:36:06.420
to modify everything

1:36:06.420,1:36:11.449
uh... converted all about the case

1:36:11.449,1:36:18.449
bosnian too

1:36:21.919,1:36:24.659
the

1:36:24.659,1:36:27.159
uh...

1:36:27.159,1:36:31.619
or my map m of underscore which will go
through an action

1:36:31.619,1:36:34.119

puts your line

current reversals just work

1:36:44.479,1:36:47.539
uh... and were able used by put his head
of a magic commercial it'll just be

1:36:47.539,1:36:50.920
whatever commercial we kinda want

1:36:50.920,1:36:53.800
uh... savior chile's you to write
controversial

1:36:53.800,1:36:57.360
it's there

1:36:57.360,1:36:58.719
socheata play it

1:36:58.719,1:37:00.260
no

1:37:00.260,1:37:01.560
in lens form

1:37:01.560,1:37:04.330
army combo it come to a lot of
commenters that were in the original

1:37:04.330,1:37:06.510
unified or really really handy

1:37:06.510,1:37:10.000
for rewriting contract reason what not
like i rewrite up will say

1:37:10.000,1:37:11.179
do you mean

1:37:11.179,1:37:15.059
by saturday goes that knows how to get a
delays and giving off onto my computer

1:37:15.059,1:37:16.059
mediated

1:37:16.059,1:37:19.519
that like is a real early michael
applied maybe it goes realtor needed

1:37:19.519,1:37:22.859
literals and turns them into literal
that is the negative value

1:37:22.859,1:37:24.409
insiders and a tree

1:37:24.409,1:37:27.320
soviet negative wit ok alternative

1:37:27.320,1:37:28.040
live

1:37:28.040,1:37:30.619
the negative right

1:37:30.619,1:37:32.369
um...

1:37:32.369,1:37:35.780
and we'll do is we'll plan it in a
bottom-up matter it'll work

1:37:35.780,1:37:37.650
they'll go into the eighties

1:37:37.650,1:37:39.679
the the descendants of a

1:37:39.679,1:37:42.460
of your your your problem with russian
look through some of her infant son

1:37:42.460,1:37:45.179
which was lapd you're going down

1:37:45.179,1:37:48.110
apply the the subject of the rewrite
roulette believes

1:37:48.110,1:37:51.170
until it doesn't apply anymore and then
walk into a tree

1:37:51.170,1:37:54.110
does one commentator and it works

1:37:54.110,1:37:57.300
um... bird doing hierarchical rewrites

1:37:57.300,1:37:58.999
not complex of

1:37:58.999,1:38:03.560
holes are both find all the one whole
contacts as a complex problem

1:38:03.560,1:38:05.040
that's a start on that

1:38:05.040,1:38:07.780
from the beginning of the talk

1:38:07.780,1:38:09.280
um...

1:38:09.280,1:38:12.179
all these nominees were derived from

1:38:12.179,1:38:15.449
they all work directly in an age
reversal

1:38:15.449,1:38:16.770
um...

1:38:16.770,1:38:20.260
it's a ticket is an incredibly powerful
efficient library and then there's one

1:38:20.260,1:38:21.150
other

1:38:21.150,1:38:25.770
kind of like the diving capital to do it
but we don't like

1:38:25.770,1:38:26.789
uh...

1:38:26.789,1:38:29.079
and that is different

1:38:29.079,1:38:31.170
so one of the questions i could ask a
lot are

1:38:31.170,1:38:35.139
what is the connection between zippers
and lenses

1:38:35.139,1:38:38.880
uh... and historically there really
hasn't meant a lot of but now there is

1:38:38.880,1:38:41.020
from

1:38:41.020,1:38:42.950
so zipper provides

1:38:42.950,1:38:45.599
are pretty nice if you know

1:38:45.599,1:38:49.109
so leaders and its allies tipper into

1:38:49.109,1:38:52.719
something let's atlas oracle were little

1:38:52.719,1:38:54.189
what is the type of us

1:38:54.189,1:38:58.579
so this is a separate uh... and for the
wamu view these things they look like my

1:38:58.579,1:39:01.969
country

1:39:01.969,1:39:02.739
um...

1:39:02.739,1:39:04.929
so we're starting at the top

1:39:04.929,1:39:11.929
and we're looking at him

1:39:12.379,1:39:15.999
and go down in up

1:39:15.999,1:39:17.409
no

1:39:17.409,1:39:19.919
uh... you were people we're conflicting
with new people

1:39:19.919,1:39:22.559
and so now i'm for joe if you see the
senate but

1:39:22.559,1:39:25.570
a new premises are messed with it if you
would like a bread from calicut you're

1:39:25.570,1:39:26.810
going to our website

1:39:26.810,1:39:29.020
there's a saying returning at the top

1:39:29.020,1:39:36.020
into a pair of strengths or down in one
st word word word outlook express

1:39:40.929,1:39:45.959
full and now we're looking at a single
character

1:39:45.959,1:39:47.220
and i want you to change

1:39:47.220,1:39:51.190
the focused element

1:39:51.190,1:39:52.460
and

1:39:52.460,1:39:55.659
i want you to move all the way to the
right

1:39:55.659,1:40:01.699
and change the focused on that uh... why

1:40:01.699,1:40:03.349
whatever type of progress with

1:40:03.349,1:40:05.929
show you the the answer to that

1:40:05.929,1:40:08.349
there

1:40:08.349,1:40:09.829
we walked down

1:40:09.829,1:40:12.239
into the first half of her

1:40:12.239,1:40:14.239
we walked down into the last year

1:40:14.239,1:40:17.659
scrub within like basically make such a
level where we can move left word in

1:40:17.659,1:40:20.780
rightward within the level so we take a
commercial

1:40:20.780,1:40:24.929
we can move left and right within the
traverse off

1:40:24.929,1:40:29.099
uh... so like left and right inside of a
zipper traditionally something where you

1:40:29.099,1:40:33.459
hafta make up a notion about the right
to make sense for your syntax rearward

1:40:33.459,1:40:37.089
and you had that figure out a class or
something browser coble workers like

1:40:37.089,1:40:38.100
that

1:40:38.100,1:40:39.710
now

1:40:39.710,1:40:41.909
you give me a terrific

1:40:41.909,1:40:43.820
zipper

1:40:43.820,1:40:45.570
doesn't have any constraints on that

1:40:45.570,1:40:48.230
i'd walk in anything

1:40:48.230,1:40:49.810
um...

1:40:49.810,1:40:50.880
music brenda one

1:40:50.880,1:40:55.210
whatsoever yeah

1:40:55.210,1:40:58.989
on those tenets

1:40:58.989,1:41:03.679
and give me are when we have to come in
to replace

1:41:03.679,1:41:06.959
that's ones

1:41:06.959,1:41:09.150
and traversed

1:41:09.150,1:41:10.379
the and

1:41:10.379,1:41:11.489
from within

1:41:11.489,1:41:14.989
that's about

1:41:14.989,1:41:21.989
and set the focus equal to

1:41:24.139,1:41:27.969
mannerism

1:41:27.969,1:41:31.500
so i went into individual bets a manager

1:41:31.500,1:41:34.380
starting at last

1:41:34.380,1:41:36.090
uh... releasing every at bat

1:41:36.090,1:41:39.300
i can't move left and right through the
bats setting them

1:41:39.300,1:41:40.820
pop back out of it

1:41:40.820,1:41:44.949
images use of the fact that i can tours
individual bets is out of in america

1:41:44.949,1:41:45.729
uh...

1:41:45.729,1:41:49.139
any data type that you want as long as
you can build some kind of windsor

1:41:49.139,1:41:54.899
traverse a lender that you can use the
zippers become abundantly

1:41:54.899,1:41:56.039
and then

1:41:56.039,1:41:59.260
pop and downed power plug breadcrumb
trail

1:41:59.260,1:42:01.159
proper portion of our country up

1:42:01.159,1:42:03.840
so given a lens it'll go down

1:42:03.840,1:42:05.439
argument reversal

1:42:05.439,1:42:08.599
that could welcomed there might not be a
personal note for the purpose of the

1:42:08.599,1:42:09.849
millions

1:42:09.849,1:42:11.840
so with investigative have maybe

1:42:11.840,1:42:15.150
you succeeded in doing

1:42:15.150,1:42:18.119
latin right actually became leftward
rightward

1:42:18.119,1:42:21.580
use geyser lawson record as well

1:42:21.580,1:42:23.540
the upcoming expert on

1:42:23.540,1:42:26.929
injure which let you tiger jerk the
zipper lock correct

1:42:26.929,1:42:31.399
of acute argument erection it will go
and gently snobby and if you jerk ipl

1:42:31.399,1:42:35.719
it will bail not coca

1:42:35.719,1:42:39.900
so the triangle reviewed toddler up in
your article at most element that will

1:42:39.900,1:42:40.640
it will

1:42:40.640,1:42:45.959
stay where you are if you'd rather go up
it'll just

1:42:45.959,1:42:47.729
um... it so it's

1:42:47.729,1:42:48.929
ability

1:42:48.929,1:42:52.650
but companies but the names were not
taken i checked

1:42:52.650,1:42:54.130
picture

1:42:54.130,1:42:56.800
nobody wanted to use those names returns

1:42:56.800,1:42:57.820
uh... dot

1:42:57.820,1:43:00.590
one opposites library at churches like
appeared riveted

1:43:00.590,1:43:02.260
uh...

1:43:02.260,1:43:06.880
no acc

1:43:06.880,1:43:08.389
and um...

1:43:08.389,1:43:12.169
so that that's basically what i got
receptors uh... they're actually happens

1:43:12.169,1:43:14.929
to be a lot more in the library um...

1:43:14.929,1:43:18.559
we've got a there's still a few if
you're interested in more uh... there's

1:43:18.559,1:43:22.000
a hassle and channel on fri node is
about forty five of us lurking in the

1:43:22.000,1:43:25.309
channel at all times that's right
answering one question for work in the

1:43:25.309,1:43:26.250
library

1:43:26.250,1:43:29.139
a lot of about them

1:43:29.139,1:43:32.429
i think we have separate matters in the
library now helmets

1:43:32.429,1:43:37.099
making very alarming progress running
version three point seven

1:43:37.099,1:43:39.780
uh... my certify months ago

1:43:39.780,1:43:41.339
uh... yeah

1:43:41.339,1:43:45.149
sorry for the whoever breaking a p_i_
but um... it's better that it is about a

1:43:45.149,1:43:46.530
live report

1:43:46.530,1:43:47.929
uh...

1:43:47.929,1:43:50.360
the um...

1:43:50.360,1:43:52.889
so the community has been pretty good
there's arm

1:43:52.889,1:43:54.879
there's a number of resources out there

1:43:54.879,1:43:57.210
for learning more about lenses um...

1:43:57.210,1:43:59.880
so first of all there is v

1:43:59.880,1:44:03.249
uh... lens back it up dot com we'll give
you a very

1:44:03.249,1:44:05.309
uh...

1:44:05.309,1:44:08.199
nothing on my screen website uh...

1:44:08.199,1:44:11.059
gives you you know um...

1:44:11.059,1:44:16.699
more about them in the tutorial in stop

1:44:16.699,1:44:19.929
and so there's a longer tutorial on how
to use lenses

1:44:19.929,1:44:22.079
various um the actual

1:44:22.079,1:44:23.599
did rob website for lands

1:44:23.599,1:44:27.169
uh... feel free to port library define
something wrong with the haddock to

1:44:27.169,1:44:28.119
recover

1:44:28.119,1:44:28.809
there's about

1:44:28.809,1:44:33.339
five hundred example back that's that
actually run every time we check in

1:44:33.339,1:44:34.699
uh... but but

1:44:34.699,1:44:36.590
keep the people's honest

1:44:36.590,1:44:39.429
about the documentation um...

1:44:39.429,1:44:42.389
beers spares a wiki

1:44:42.389,1:44:43.550
that has a lot of

1:44:43.550,1:44:46.599
the the stuff that i work through a
matter of asian

1:44:46.599,1:44:50.389
op bak about why we do a good thing
certain way it's etcetera

1:44:50.389,1:44:53.639
on there's a lot of resources out there
uh... try to get as much of it is

1:44:53.639,1:44:56.109
community in the morning enough it was
possible

1:44:56.109,1:44:57.820
'cause i'm only one person

1:44:57.820,1:45:00.309
and person reportedly warn you this

1:45:00.309,1:45:01.859
um...

1:45:01.859,1:45:03.889
and

1:45:03.889,1:45:06.139
are you

1:45:06.139,1:45:11.129
what people the understand lenses gotten
uh... not

1:45:11.129,1:45:13.480
i hope is that the useful

1:45:13.480,1:45:15.030
um...

1:45:15.030,1:45:16.199
that's all i've done

1:45:16.199,1:45:23.199
a

1:45:37.069,1:45:38.269
heart-rendering

1:45:38.269,1:45:41.189
for are cat

1:45:41.189,1:45:44.959
uh... might wrap up this whole
collection by various for instance uh...

1:45:44.959,1:45:47.300
if you look at like math intel
collections

1:45:47.300,1:45:50.840
they're not map rather they're they're
they're map

1:45:50.840,1:45:55.739
traverses pairs of key values where you
can't really reason about like the park

1:45:55.739,1:45:57.630
a reality of mac

1:45:57.630,1:46:00.940
so if you want to work with map you have
to map over mail and i converted to

1:46:00.940,1:46:02.230
malcolm

1:46:02.230,1:46:05.349
literally so in order to work with map
europe was always working like that

1:46:05.349,1:46:08.049
three bodies that have happened in it

1:46:08.049,1:46:09.479
uh...

1:46:09.479,1:46:13.239
and so uh... to me i'm one of the
strongest things that i get out of

1:46:13.239,1:46:16.659
are haskell is is permitted in the event
and lost

1:46:16.659,1:46:17.749
um...

1:46:17.749,1:46:20.290
when i when i look at the scala
collections library

1:46:20.290,1:46:23.570
there's very little that you can use out
of it parametric where there's very

1:46:23.570,1:46:26.480
little that you can go all this whole
because all containers i could be jesus

1:46:26.480,1:46:27.340
come later

1:46:27.340,1:46:30.209
i have used at hotmail ad-hoc

1:46:30.209,1:46:37.209
on a proper collection base a basis

1:46:38.349,1:46:41.619
presence here we have indexed reversals
for for maps

1:46:41.619,1:46:44.330
so there's a whole i didn't talk about
an expendable

1:46:44.330,1:46:47.270
uh... but like if you want to have
access to the keys inside of your mouth

1:46:47.270,1:46:50.270
while you walk over and i had something
very similar to that isomorphism ac

1:46:50.270,1:46:53.530
telecoms work within next reversals as
well so you have access to the keys and

1:46:53.530,1:46:55.789
putting up a huge reversal is that uh...

1:46:55.789,1:46:59.749
evolving you get index list of the cover

1:46:59.749,1:47:05.139
i find that particular approach to be
much more practically reasonable

1:47:05.139,1:47:06.420
van

1:47:06.420,1:47:09.530
the um... scholar collections approach
where

1:47:09.530,1:47:13.900
now i can mash i can map over the
contents but i can't reason about that

1:47:13.900,1:47:18.949
map out that map g equals map f tuje
because i might map in the meantime i

1:47:18.949,1:47:22.039
might smashed through two pulls together
that

1:47:22.039,1:47:23.540
now make my mouth

1:47:23.540,1:47:26.110
i know if you were omens of
controversial

1:47:26.110,1:47:27.729
um...

1:47:27.729,1:47:31.030
i likewise i'd like the ability to other
understand

1:47:31.030,1:47:32.170
demigod

1:47:32.170,1:47:34.519
in my experience writing a lot of celica

1:47:34.519,1:47:41.289
i have not had that

1:47:41.289,1:47:44.139
thinkin

1:47:44.139,1:47:46.300
he quickly

1:47:46.300,1:47:49.510
you know i really sitting in the library
cover souls or something but the nobody

1:47:49.510,1:47:50.530
wrote that

1:47:50.530,1:47:53.630
uh... no

1:47:53.630,1:47:58.120
at it really really is all about
politics i happen to be able to use the

1:47:58.120,1:47:59.719
lens commenters graph

1:47:59.719,1:48:03.119
um... and not lenses in themselves
because everybody hears the word lands

1:48:03.119,1:48:07.820
ago ally note that as i've looked at efi
labels that access url phalanx

1:48:07.820,1:48:08.989
um...

1:48:08.989,1:48:10.940
and really

1:48:10.940,1:48:14.849
i think after going through the content
of that doc al you've got a feeling that

1:48:14.849,1:48:17.280
this is not about that

1:48:17.280,1:48:18.750
it's

1:48:18.750,1:48:21.770
it's basically everything that i can
take out of the other hand for classes

1:48:21.770,1:48:23.929
that we already know how to use in-house
golan

1:48:23.929,1:48:30.929
and generalize applicable dot

1:48:32.929,1:48:36.429
though about the texans yes

1:48:36.429,1:48:37.360
arm

1:48:37.360,1:48:39.979
actually you know what they can do about
it

1:48:39.979,1:48:46.659
uh... i i i i have a yarnell diagram nah
we are so i think i added that in our

1:48:46.659,1:48:47.860
settlers have

1:48:47.860,1:48:51.580
accessories that

1:48:51.580,1:48:52.939
craft

1:48:52.939,1:48:53.939
no

1:48:53.939,1:48:56.609
so i was i actually a mouth agar i'm
describing the relationship between

1:48:56.609,1:48:58.489
those different classes right

1:48:58.489,1:49:01.560
so we can say that every traverse eliza
ballad bold

1:49:01.560,1:49:05.570
right beverage reversals of alexander

1:49:05.570,1:49:09.130
uh... every getter reaction of these
things ho actions were not according to

1:49:09.130,1:49:10.659
the chance to talk about

1:49:10.659,1:49:12.309
uh...

1:49:12.309,1:49:15.550
bring them down and i a gram and see
that everyone's canoes directly at the

1:49:15.550,1:49:17.729
debtor

1:49:17.729,1:49:22.219
everyone everyone's commute to work for
network in the above the fold

1:49:22.219,1:49:25.819
and as a way that i thought

1:49:25.819,1:49:29.230
sabri isomorphism is a valid lands and
develop prism

1:49:29.230,1:49:31.320
which is the period or just talk about

1:49:31.320,1:49:38.320
and by the visa valid commercial

offshore comment about the slides by
just by one of the

1:49:45.949,1:49:48.360
sneak that in there

1:49:48.360,1:49:55.360
i think that works

1:49:57.699,1:50:00.280
is as soon as i dropped up your

1:50:00.280,1:50:01.689
and ab

1:50:01.689,1:50:08.689
by gamblers

1:50:11.429,1:50:14.980
saudi arabia weak and pump tear so that
the bunker doesn't use the argument

1:50:14.980,1:50:18.300
you get get a ball which is that class
and it is briefly

1:50:18.300,1:50:20.969
right then and you get a better

1:50:20.969,1:50:24.340
did you have got to get a bulletin for

1:50:24.340,1:50:26.619
then you have the actual getter

1:50:26.619,1:50:29.050
class that we use

1:50:29.050,1:50:30.010
and that you have a

1:50:30.010,1:50:34.429
irritable and apply get a you have the
ability to smash values together

1:50:34.429,1:50:36.880
with your and

1:50:36.880,1:50:39.889
but you know that the arguably actual
values that you use preparer don't

1:50:39.889,1:50:40.929
matter

1:50:40.929,1:50:43.139
and seattle

1:50:43.139,1:50:44.690
so gavel

1:50:44.690,1:50:47.159
applicable bunker

1:50:47.159,1:50:54.159
hierarchy is how you value can derive
everything except the tether

1:50:57.499,1:51:01.349
yes that in this cut in this case in
practice i have a sellable class that's

1:51:01.349,1:51:04.310
as sites market on a uh...

1:51:04.310,1:51:08.419
it stated that has built no prob other
than me

1:51:08.419,1:51:11.899
and i actually abuse those classes to
make

1:51:11.899,1:51:15.099
on his number come in and i didn't get
the job here like there's backward and

1:51:15.099,1:51:18.850
forward but like reverse it reversal
aural and or s letter

1:51:18.850,1:51:23.450
or a drummer or or i gather or a portly
other they'll turn like melissa of all

1:51:23.450,1:51:26.729
the things that's going to visit
services in the opposite order

1:51:26.729,1:51:29.829
u_n_ brought restrict actually knows
actually wind up being

1:51:29.829,1:51:32.679
kind of like acquitted friend former
client like that with that but i don't

1:51:32.679,1:51:33.699
know

1:51:33.699,1:51:37.069
also actually abuse back last thing that
i had to do so that i could get better

1:51:37.069,1:51:38.340
tigers

1:51:38.340,1:51:39.389
uh... to make

1:51:39.389,1:51:46.389
a lot of very generic company allotment

1:51:47.250,1:51:50.210
yeah i'd say it's really just how we
instantiate applicants richard but i

1:51:50.210,1:51:52.260
doubt that that use

1:51:52.260,1:51:57.530
how these things that are operating that
that's how we get

1:51:57.530,1:52:04.530
i guess they've sort of alcock
overloading that makes lansdale

1:52:06.069,1:52:11.289
yet of the deadly whether or not it's
allowed to be any model under any value

1:52:11.289,1:52:18.289
it has to be a particular value

1:52:19.570,1:52:22.369
uh... and then i get that these are
actually all implemented by class with a

1:52:22.369,1:52:29.369
couple getting which is

1:52:32.980,1:52:38.409
reserved for heads up

1:52:38.409,1:52:45.409
well i tell ya personnel

1:52:49.719,1:52:53.139
whole arm

1:52:53.139,1:52:57.010
there is there is a that notion of
strength of a of a cover contra strong

1:52:57.010,1:53:01.050
and haskell so that we abuse very could
not be able to patient

1:53:01.050,1:53:05.230
um... of lending here abuses the
strength of reconquer nasco

1:53:05.230,1:53:08.839
so one way to construct a prism is to
abuse sco strength

1:53:08.839,1:53:14.520
of of certain bunkers that allow you to
go search for

1:53:14.520,1:53:16.530
uh...

1:53:16.530,1:53:21.929
weaken left dike an a in a half would be
to uh... apathy and b

1:53:21.929,1:53:23.859
ever ever every pondering cast list
right

1:53:23.859,1:53:26.909
uh... because the way the advocate
environment

1:53:26.909,1:53:27.630
um...

1:53:27.630,1:53:31.760
not every quarter and haskell is coastal

1:53:31.760,1:53:34.149
blog post on strict discussed right

1:53:34.149,1:53:39.139
i think it's driving trek from waiting
that sort of like that not

1:53:39.139,1:53:43.619
not

1:53:43.619,1:53:46.250
on what i'm talking about dot com

1:53:46.250,1:53:49.310
now though at least explain the fact is
buckled up

1:53:49.310,1:53:51.840
account of the that um... the constraint

1:53:51.840,1:53:54.109
proper driving for them

1:53:54.109,1:53:56.179
uh... because we don't have potential

1:53:56.179,1:53:57.579
i'll read

1:53:57.579,1:53:58.920
though a

1:53:58.920,1:54:00.000
um...

1:54:00.000,1:54:01.499
he he was

1:54:01.499,1:54:03.499
sort of the theoretical side of

1:54:03.499,1:54:05.829
um... for them so i drive them one way

1:54:05.829,1:54:10.190
just from like reading about them really
are not matter in writing respectable

1:54:10.190,1:54:16.540
them the conversion exacting definition
so we were very happy that we got

1:54:16.540,1:54:20.360
i feel like i was one two three we could
drive lost like four five always welcome

1:54:20.360,1:54:22.879
the same laws

1:54:22.879,1:54:29.879
uh... only had one more

1:54:29.879,1:54:31.439
warlock theory

1:54:31.439,1:54:33.629
millwall

1:54:33.629,1:54:38.550
it no

1:54:38.550,1:54:40.320
uh...

1:54:40.320,1:54:40.679
well thank you
