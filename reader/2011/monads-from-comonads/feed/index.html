		<description>Yeah, looks like he never published the slides on the relevant talk. I&#039;ll bug him about that.</description>

		<description>Acutally, it _was_ pretty much pulled out of a hat. ;)

It came out as a happy accident in an email discussion with Russell O&#039;Connor and Jacques Carette about exactly in what sense Store and State were dual.</description>

		<description>Thank you for an awesome blog post! Though I wonder where the &#039;Co&#039; data type comes from. You just pull it out of a hat. Is there a story behind it?</description>

		<description>@Edward: I can&#039;t find any links to Dominic&#039;s material on the topic other than his subsequent discussions of codo notation. In there the only thing he has that mixes monads with comonads is a notion of &#039;bido&#039; notation, which is pretty much what sigfpe and Uustalu and Vene have independently advocated as ways to deal with distributive laws over monads and comonads. Sadly, I think that approach doesn&#039;t work out well in practice. I prefer working with comonads over a Kleisli category or monads over a Cokleisli category instead, rather than distributing. This lets me get decent computation sharing.</description>

		<description>An interesting consequence of this set of transformations was the long-standing debate on whether or not streams were more appropriately monads or comonads. I believe Dominic Orchard has written on this topic (http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/31165). I really need to work through this material properly :-)</description>
