		<description>@Victor: 

Not yet. 

Haskell is one of my use cases though, which is why the Literate and Layout parser transformers exist in the first place. My current focus has been on getting a usable C preprocessing parser transformer and rudimentary packrat support (because otherwise layout parsing is particularly expensive re-playing the &#039;whiteSpace/virtual semicolon/virtual right brace&#039; parser at the same location over and over. 

This is what led to this pair of articles.

I do have a small prototype implementation of Daan Leijen&#039;s HMF which uses trifecta to parse. Once I&#039;m happier with it and obtain final permission to release it, that may serve as such a tutorial.</description>

		<description>Is there a tutorial-style documentation for trifecta that can be used to build Haskell 2010 parser with layout rule and fixity resolution using explicitly-lazy/iteratee/coroutine-style IO?</description>
