		<description>BMeph: 1.) nah, the costrength used here was derived from relaxing the notion from a comonad to a functor in the same way that strength was weakened from mstrength.

2.) Even with some random Monoid constraint on e it wouldn&#039;t give you the power to enumerate all possible values of e, to complete the costrength.</description>

		<description>Sorry to only be responding to this three years later, but:
1) Shouldn&#039;t the costrength case have the added constraint (Monoid e), if only for conformity to its Comonadic form?
2) Is there a way we can exploit the (Monoid e) constraint to give us a meaningful result for costrength?</description>

		<description>[...] So can we convert between an apomorphism and an Elgot algebra? For a somewhat circuitous path to that answer lets recall the definition of strength from my post a couple of weeks ago. Flipping the arguments and direction of application for strength to simplify what is coming we get: [...]</description>

		<description>A follow-up in case anyone cares about this stuff. A lot can be said about &quot;the meaning of strength:&quot;

		<description>One of the Estonians&#039; comonadic papers talk about zippability: w a -&gt; w b -&gt; w (a,b). 

I definitely like to know what you thought about that concept and its dual, if any.</description>
