		<description>Isn&#039;t the type (exists a. f a a) the coproduct rather than the coend?  The coend is the coproduct modulo the relation imposed by the commuting square (degenerate hexagon) in the definition of a dinatural transformation.</description>

		<description>I have written bits and pieces here and there over the years -- I used to write a lot of magazine articles in particular, and I think there is an old column by me still floating around on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flipcode.com/harmless/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;flipcode&lt;/a&gt;. 

These days I have a lot less time for writing, however. What makes it to this blog are mostly just the things that I found interesting enough to share. To get the message out I largely rely on syndication through planet haskell and reddit, both of which makes the location of the source content less of an issue these days than it used to be. Those have more overlap with would-be readership for this sort of content than almost any mainstream web site I can know of.</description>

		<description>Have you ever considered about contributing on additional web sites? You have some great content right here and I’m certain you can share a lot far more when you wrote some content throughout other web sites. You will discover a great deal of associated web-sites to check out. Only one thing to look at. I’m glad I know about it at least.</description>

		<description>Just a minor typo note:

&gt; newtype RanT f g c m m&#039; = (c -&gt; K m) -&gt; T m&#039;

Should be:

&gt; newtype RanT k t c m m&#039; = (c -&gt; k m) -&gt; t m&#039;

right?</description>

		<description>All of the various types of naturality (including dinaturality and extranaturality) seem to arise as free theorems but I&#039;ve not seen a paper spelling this out clearly - at least not in a form I&#039;d recognise. I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s because nobody has figured it the details, or if the papers are just over my head.</description>

		<description>Hey Dan,

Fixed the LanT definition. (Woops!) 

Re the dinatural transformation piece, I&#039;m not as deep as I used to be in this area, so I&#039;ll go back and see what I can dig up from whatever notes I still have from when I wrote this. I recall it seeming quite obvious at the time, but now I can only barely remember what dinaturality is. :) I&#039;d be quite surprised (and pleased) if you came up with a counterexample, however. ;)</description>

		<description>Now that I&#039;ve been thinking about these things I can point out a tiny tiny typo:

data LanT k t c m m&#039; = LanT (k m -&gt; c) (t m)

should probably be

data LanT k t c m m&#039; = LanT (k m -&gt; c) (t m&#039;)

though it makes no difference in the definition of Lan.

On a less trivial level, I still don&#039;t know what theorem I could quote to justify that, say,

type DinaturalFromObject x s = x -&gt; forall a. s a a

defines dinaturals from a constant functor. For a specific choice of s dinaturality is a free theorem. But how do you uniformly prove this for all s, implemented in Haskell, with the right c/contravariance in the arguments?</description>
