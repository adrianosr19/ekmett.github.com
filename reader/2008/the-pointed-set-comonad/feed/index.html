		<description>Anything with mzero (or empty) cannot be a comonad, as far as I can tell; extract and mzero are mutually exclusive.</description>

		<description>Sorry for asking this so late after your writing, but I have been looking at a lot of info that I should have learned in my mid-twenties - plus, I&#039;m slow ;)

Anyway, I was wondering if you know of a class of objects categories that work like monads, but have no &quot;zero&quot; (a la MonadZero in Haskell), and seem to work just fine as comonads - in fact they are comonads?</description>
