		<description>Honestly, I&#039;m pretty far behind in the record debate. Mostly because the signal to noise ratio was bad enough that I just gave up on it. In practice the use of lenses is mostly orthogonal to SORF/DORF.

This does largely address the use of something like . as a field accessor though, because foo^.bar.baz.quux does exactly what an OOP developer would expect.</description>

		<description>You mentioned at the end that record reform proposals should consider these concepts.  Have you thought about what those considerations might be for the current record namespace initiative (e.g. the proposals on http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Records, or even just SORF/DORF)?</description>
